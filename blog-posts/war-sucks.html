                              Baseball is a gorgeously paced game, to an extent that almost defies description. Its drama operates 
                              in negative space, the slow-burning tension that matures and warps and snaps into action. The ball 
                              moves faster than in any other game this side of jai alai, tearing through still air and distilling 
                              the game into a series of rapid, beautifully unfair uncertainties. Wins are the 0-1 binary outcome 
                              the best run-creating and run-preventing efforts of 50 players are reduced to, and it is in their 
                              service that baseball, at least when the world is spinning, is played.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              For those of us thankfully free enough from insufferable debates about baseball statistics to not 
                              have an opinion, WAR stands for Wins Above Replacement. The idea is that this number, more so than 
                              the humble home run or on-base percentage could ever hope to, tells you how many more wins a player 
                              gets you every year than a given 25-year-old playing in Triple-A Wichita, a lovely quantity to be able 
                              to know for sure. It’s a seductive concept, this idea of a number that tells you the value of a player 
                              in the only units that matter, and something it would undoubtedly be nice to have a great estimate of.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              And it turns out our estimates are pretty good! The number of WAR your team has correlates

                                extremely well
                              </a> 
                              with the number of games your team wins, better than any other stat we can think of.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              This bullet point is usually enough to facilitate intelligent discussion of baseball. And like any 
                              baseball nerd, I like WAR for this reason! Once everyone agrees on and understands its usefulness, 
                              it is a sound and robust measure of baseball performance that levels discussions on temporally-adjusted 
                              terms. Gone are the days where imagining 2018 Lorenzo Cain’s impact on the 1971 Dodgers is a fully 
                              abstract exercise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              WAR has a tragic flaw though: it sucks. And not for the reasons that usually make this argument a 
                              nauseatingly boring one. It is also killing baseball.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              So why the controversy? For the grouchy columnist on your local sports page, and dads everywhere, 
                              it’s easy. We watch baseball games all the time, and we have our own ideas of who to credit for 
                              wins and losses. Sometimes players have great games and lose. Sometimes one player completely and 
                              unilaterally blows it. Sometimes it seems like the starting pitcher deserves credit for the entire 
                              win. WAR, offering a neat sum of these contributions, philosophically cuts through these subtleties 
                              entirely. And it’s easy to see why this might offend the sensibilities of baseball fans, notoriously 
                              rational and unromantic as we are. You thought

                            <p>
                              Sure, those of us who watch a lot of games can reason about portioning out this credit with a little 
                              more complexity than this, but the cavemen who announce these games certainly can’t, and they love 
                              little more than making this known to the viewer. In a sport that has spent decades centering its 
                              business model and TV contracts on people watching their local team every day, this same casual fan 
                              who is supposed to buy what the MLB is selling for the next 40 years gets to hear 5 times a week about 
                              how confusing these new stats are, and how WAR just doesn’t sit right with the voice of their favorite 
                              team. It is terrible for baseball for the same reason it took me 7 paragraphs to even get this far. For 
                              their part, though, baseball’s more careful thinkers are not doing WAR any service.

                              Here’s Tom Tango, a baseball thinker I have intense respect for, posting an endlessly complex analogy 
                              that will surely clear up the WAR confusion once and for all:

                              quarantine to once again attempt to put this debate to bed: 
                              <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My central objection to WAR is not really that there is anything at all wrong with WAR.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Just look at how inane the responses are<sup>1</sup>, especially to Bill’s tweet. This discussion never, ever 
                              changes, and instead of arguing about literally anything else, WAR’s great gift to baseball has been 
                              an eternal, insufferable argumentative carousel where everyone is always right and nobody is ever making 
                              a point. That I can feel myself hopping on now, getting sucked into the same dumb argument about whether 
                              this one number is an affront to everything beautiful about life, is part of the reason why we have to 
                              get rid of it. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The larger reason is that, for most purposes, it is useless.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              I’ll quote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement">Wikipedia entry for WAR</a>. Here’s the first paragraph:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote><i>
                              “The basis for a WAR value is the estimated number of runs contributed by a player through offensive 
                              actions such as batting and base running, and runs denied to opposition teams by the player through 
                              defensive actions like fielding and pitching. Statistics such as weighted on-base average (wOBA), 
                              ultimate zone rating (UZR), ultimate base running (UBR), and defense independent pitching statistics 
                              (DIPS) measure the effectiveness of a player at creating and saving runs for their team, on a per-plate 
                              appearance or per-inning basis. These statistics can be multiplied by the playing time of a player to 
                              give an estimate of the number of offensive and defensive runs contributed to their team.”
                            </i></blockquote>
                            <p>
                              Crazy, right? Sounds complex, looks like a lot of effort went into making this a sound estimate! Anyway, 
                              here’s the next sentence:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                              "Additional runs contributed to a team lead to additional wins, with 10 runs estimated to be equal to roughly one win."
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                              I mean, are you kidding me? All that math to tell you how many runs a player gave their team, and then we just divide it 
                              by 10 and call it wins? <i>This</i> is the stat people tear their hair out over?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Mike Trout didn’t win you 9.6 games last year; he netted you 96 runs. Framing this debate in terms of what WAR is actually 
                              measuring, the run value a player is creating for you, makes the noise associated with these numbers bearable too. It is 
                              obvious that this number, Runs Above Replacement, will bounce around season-by-season, and that a 48 RAR season isn’t all 
                              that different from a 50 RAR season. Maybe the 76 runs Marcus Semien created for the A’s in 2019 translated to more wins 
                              than the 60 runs Ichiro gave the 2001 Mariners. The inferences that go into those numbers, however, are eminently more 
                              believable as inputs to the addition and subtraction of runs than they are as requests of fans to buy that Semien won 
                              the A’s 7.6 games while Ichiro won 6.0 for the Mariners. Which is insane because they are the same inferences, except for 
                              the part where we divided by 10!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Again, this wouldn’t be a problem if everyone who wanted to talk baseball did their homework all the time, but this will 
                              never happen. When we push away the people who don’t want to think about the epistemological rigors of the numbers that 
                              have taken over the sport they’ve loved since they were 6, we shove them backwards into a comfortable stone age that is 
                              harming the product for today’s 6-year-olds. RBI, which depends almost entirely on factors outside of the batter’s control, 
                              is to a well-documented extent as stupid and arbitrary as it gets, yet cavemen in broadcast booths still turn to it as their 
                              preferred measure of offensive output, because those of us who can produce real statistics have dramatically failed at 
                              providing competition. When we spit out decent guesses of idealized quantities, we obscure the accessible intermediate 
                              conclusions that our hard work is generating and throwing away, all for a marginal abstract benefit for us eggheads who 
                              think we know better.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              With one quick change, so stupid it’s almost cosmetic, we can get rid of the actually dumb stats like RBI that lead to 
                              actually dumb conclusions. If you want to convert RAR to WAR you can just imagine the decimal point there. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Runs are concrete and small. Everyone knows the pieces that go into making and preventing runs, and that’s what everyone 
                              on a baseball diamond is always trying to do. Everyone understands that they don’t all come at the same time, or when you 
                              necessarily want them, that a handful of players are responsible to some degree for each of them, and that having more of 
                              them is always nice. This is the kind of thing we should be measuring, and it is a little absurd that we take a rigorous yet 
                              digestible stat like RAR and decide to make it a headache by dividing it by 10. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/war_explained_position.shtml">Over very long periods of time</a>, this 
                              denominator does actually vary a fair amount, as the long-term trend is a real increase in runs scored, but the necessary 
                              contextual adjustment RAR would need to compare Tris Speaker and Andruw Jones is one we make in our heads all the time for 
                              home runs, triples, strikeouts, and any other counting stat in baseball. The overwhelming bulk of baseball discussion does 
                              not need this adjustment, because normal people having a conversation in between the third and fourth innings of a ballgame 
                              on a sunny day don’t generally try to compare a statline from 1916 to one from 2005 - we compare one statline from 2019 to 
                              another from 2019. There is no need to translate a concept accessible on the level of “runs added” to the highest abstraction 
                              of outcome possible, and dooming ostensibly fun baseball discussion to statistical semantic hell is not worth the tidy 
                              universality of contextual intertemporal run value adjustment. WAR, which outsources this adjustment to the computer, is great 
                              for rarer exercises in baseball discussion like comparing careers, long-separated seasons, and overall team strength. It 
                              should stick to those.

                              As neat as it would be to be able to portion them out for sure, wins are stochastic and ugly. Their unpredictability on an 
                              individual level gives baseball its beauty. Great teams lose to bad teams every day, and a game of baseball is never, ever over 
                              until it is actually over. As long as the game is still going, the win has not been decided even if several runs have, and if 
                              your team plays perfectly going forward you will win the game. To the extent that a win is a product of constraint, forcing the 
                              brilliant, complex mess of a ballgame into a 1 and a 0, it only ever occurs because one team played well enough as a unit to win 
                              on their own merits. There is no kneeling out the clock, no garbage time, no reason to give up. I might just be a romantic who 
                              misses baseball, but there is something real and magical here that we lose when we run in circles arguing about whether this one 
                              number just ended our argument.

                              The great part is that, whether or not anyone actually takes it as a be-all end-all, the toothpaste is never going back in the 
                              tube on this one. Your team’s 67-year-old color commentator will never get sick of talking about those people, real or not, or 
                              anyone who dares imagine they can think about baseball as intelligently as your team’s first baseman from 1979 to 1985.

                              Because he’s the one who’s right. Winning <i>is</i> the be-all end-all of sports, and the promoters of WAR frankly should’ve realized 
                              their stat would have this effect. It is obviously and uninterestingly impossible to perfectly represent a baseball season or 
                              career in one number, and none of us nerds who sit behind computers will ever understand the game like your team’s color 
                              commentator had to to make it out of Double-A Huntsville in 1991. We didn’t spend years looking out of bus windows, thinking 
                              about laying off 1-2 sliders on hot nights in front of a couple thousand people, and intentionally or not we project a kind of 
                              arrogance when we imply that we know what a win is anyway. When every action of every player can be isolated, chopped into its 
                              constituent parts and reassembled largely according to the whims of the hardy researcher, we behind the computers have some 
                              responsibility to make sure our output is productive beyond idealized abstraction. Yes, winning is everything, but a statistic 
                              will never be everything, and a statistic that takes an idealistic stab at everything, with an implied nod to 5 caveats that the 
                              fan is responsible for appreciating, is worse than nothing.

                              This isn’t a problem unique to baseball - any number of spreadsheet dweebs are trying their best to reduce talking about the NBA 
                              to a set of interacting VORPs - but a sport that increasingly leverages its business on fans having a relationship with their team, 
                              and by extension their local broadcasts, just cannot afford the mutual contempt between the reality of the game and the language it 
                              is spoken in. Nobody likes arguing about WAR, and nobody will ever win the argument when both sides are arguing that the argument is 
                              over. “We” on the numbers side will never convince the people who actually play baseball that our number knows better than they do, and 
                              they will never take us seriously as long as we even hint that this is what our number is trying to do. Our efforts to take baseball as 
                              seriously as is computationally possible ultimately undermine a game that sparks joy in its unseriousness.

                              Baseball is a beautiful thing. Devoting oxygen to picking it apart is a waste of everyone’s time, and nobody likes wasting everyone’s time 
                              like the cranky old men that don’t seem to have enough of it. I certainly don’t have the energy to litigate this philosophical battle forever, 
                              not least when we don’t have to. Just give us RAR, leave WAR to the historians, and let us have our game back. It’s more fun this way.
