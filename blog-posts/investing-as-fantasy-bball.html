                                <h2>How Investing Became My New Fantasy Basketball</h2>
                                <h4>By Devang Patel | July 8, 2020</h4>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                I was distraught by the NBA season’s cancellation in early March. Fantasy basketball had
                                become a large part of my life, I was fresh off of a championship in my league, and I was almost
                                guaranteed a second one this year. Coming home from school and finishing the semester at home
                                was devastating, yet it may have been a blessing in disguise because I began actively managing
                                my own portfolio. In doing so, I realized that the skills I gained in fantasy basketball were highly
                                applicable to trading.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Starting with a blank portfolio was the same as beginning my draft. Who were the top
                                players I wanted to build around? In basketball, I stuck to players who finished consistently well
                                down the stretch, taking Andre Drummond and Russell Westbrook in the first two rounds.
                                Drummond was an easy pick for a league dependent on field goal efficiency and rebounding, as
                                was Westbrook, arguably the greatest stat-stuffer of all time. Understanding the rules and values
                                each player brought let me evaluate them holistically. I treated my portfolio the same way,
                                picking companies such as JP Morgan, Facebook, Netflix, and Target to build around.
                                Consistency was something I needed in order to mitigate risk, and these companies all had great
                                track records, notwithstanding struggles around the March 23rd market lows. They were worthy
                                investments in my eyes, star players that could be relied upon to perform day-in and day-out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After selecting my top players/stocks, I went to see which players could be primed for a
                                breakout. Similar to Brandon Ingram getting traded to the Pelicans and exploding onto the scene
                                as a clear All-Star caliber player, DraftKings was my breakout stock when it performed
                                significantly well in anticipation of the return of sports. Both moves substantially helped push
                                my portfolio/team to the next level. I took an educated chance on what made logical sense,
                                without delving deeply into the financials and multiples, and I relied on knowledge I had about
                                the likely immediate effects of headline-grabbing news. I lacked the technical knowledge to
                                carry out those analyses, forcing me to rely on my intuition alone. Nonetheless, for a stock
                                trading 700x earnings to have a run up like that, taking 40% profits and getting out while ahead
                                was the approach I decided to take. The same was true for the airlines, which I believed were
                                primed to breakout as the economy reopened. As a result of accurately predicting these
                                breakouts , my investments in DraftKings, American Airlines, and United Airlines have been
                                three of my highest grossing investments. But once again, my fantasy basketball days helped me
                                to avoid a classic pitfall. I learned that just because Coby White is on a hot streak doesn’t mean
                                he will sustain his elevated output. It is crucial to analyze what factors led to the streak. Did the
                                starting point guard get hurt, or were they in rebuilding mode? It’s hard to know for sure, but
                                erring on the side of caution was the best thing to do. In the stock market, selling high is the
                                same as trading a player following a good run. Yes, they may continue the streak, but once
                                you’ve already made your gains on that asset, it might be the time to get out.

                                When you think Hertz and Avis, you think direct competition, and rightly so, but for this
                                analogy, it’s best to view them as teammates. If Anthony Davis gets hurt or traded, it would be
                                reasonable to assume that LeBron James, Davis’ teammate on the Lakers, may now have a larger
                                workload and a more substantial statline. As soon as Andre Drummond was traded from the
                                Pistons to the Cavaliers, I picked up Christian Wood, Drummond’s direct replacement. This
                                move was pivotal in elevating my team’s performance. To draw a business parallel, Hertz
                                declared bankruptcy on May 22, causing their stock price to plummet. This sudden demise of
                                Hertz helped skyrocket the Avis stock, and my dad capitalized on this by gaining 80% on his
                                investment in Avis in roughly a week. This really intrigued me, because it helped me understand
                                where to look for potential breakout companies.
                            </p>

                                The fundamentals of fantasy and investing align more than one might expect, and I’m
                                grateful I found these similarities. T he complementary nature of these lessons has helped me
                                amplify my gains in both realms . As I move forward, I am intrigued by what other similarities
                                may emerge from this analogy, and if my investment experience can now aid my fantasy
                                strategy. For those of you with fantasy experience who may be reading this to get a start with
                                investing, know that you’re already ahead of the game and might know more than you think.
