                          <p>
This year, one of the most anticipated teams in the NBA is none other than the new-look Toronto Raptors. With the departure of longtime franchise player DeMar DeRozan and the additions of Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green from the San Antonio Spurs, the Raptors have certainly changed their current identity and project to be a much better team. It is clear that Kawhi, when healthy, is one of the most dynamic and gifted two-way players in the league and a perennial MVP and Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Green, on the other hand, remains an impactful 3-and-D wing that can help space the floor and move the ball across the floor. In addition, head coach Nick Nurse hopes to build upon the successful motion-based offense he implemented as assistant coach last year and create a switch-heavy defensive that emphasizes length, versatility, and lockdown one-on-one play. These aforementioned characteristics are traits that the excellent but isolation-heavy DeRozan never was able to put together in his time in Toronto, and the Raptors are all but guaranteed to feature a much different style of play compared to earlier years.
</p>

<p>
To begin, not much has to really be said about Kawhi Leonard and his impact on defense. Beyond the accolades (2 time Defensive Player of the Year in 2015 and 2016 and 4 time All-Defensive Team), Kawhi’s advanced statistics have demonstrated exactly just how crucial he had been on the Spurs. Between 2013 and 2017, Leonard’s defensive win shares (3.9, 4.4, 5.5, 4.7) ranked among the top 6 in the league and his defensive rating, while largely indicative of overall team defensive play, during this period was 98.2, 96.4, 96, and 101.5, which was also good for top 10 in the league. He, along with renowned perimeter defender Jimmy Butler, is one of the few players in NBA history to accumulate a greater number of steals than personal fouls, and during his final two years before his gruesome injury in the 2016 Western Conference Semifinals vs the Warriors, ranked top 5 overall in both VORP and overall win shares. In terms of regular counting statistics too, Kawhi has had career averages of 1.8 steals and 0.7 blocks per game, with his steal percentage (percentage of possessions ending in his stealing of the opponents’ ball) continuing to rank in the top 10 of the league ever since his rookie year in 2011. Meanwhile, Danny Green, while often overlooked in favor of his All-Star wing counterpart, has historically been an excellent perimeter defender, making the All-Defensive Team just two years ago. He has hovered around 3 defensive win shares per year since 2013 and in 2017, placed among the top 10 in defensive box plus minus, which measures defensive points per 100 possessions above a league average player. It is a valid concern that his offensive averages fell off last year, especially with regards to his effective field goal percentage, but Green has publicly stated that he played the entire year with a groin tear and even managed obtain a career high 1.1 blocks per game and obtain around his average of 1 steal per game. Here, keep in mind that the lower the defensive rating, the better, as defensive rating is an measure of points score per 100 possessions.

<p>
All of these statistics really point to the fact that Leonard and Green, when fully healthy, is one of the best wing-defender tandems in the NBA and can provide significant value to the Raptors on the opposing end, being able to collectively lock down notorious forwards in their conference such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Gordon Hayward, and more players with similar builds. Leonard, standing at 6’6 with a 7’3 wingspan, and Green, also of the same height as Leonard but with a 7’1 wingspan, are both remarkable physical anomalies to the usual swingmen found in the league and have been renowned for using their length, strength, and lateral quickness in locking down opposing players, most notoriously LeBron James during the Spurs’ 2014 championship title. As a whole, the Spurs had been a top ranked defense since the emergence of these two players, ranking in top 3 in defensive rating ever since 2012 and even setting a record 99.0 defensive rating in 2015. It remains to be seen if the Spurs are able to sustain this level of defensive intensity with the loss of their two best individual defenders and the addition of a poorer wing defender in DeRozan, but last year’s season that featured only 9 games of Leonard also beared fruit to a top 3 finish in defensive ranking once again.

<p>
However, the Toronto Raptors, already a top 5 team in terms of defensive rating (105.9) and top 10 in opponent points per game (103.9), only look to improve with the additions of historically great defenders in both Leonard and Green. The Raptors look to capitalize on the length of players such as OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam to pair them with both Green and Leonard to create a sort of a death lineup. All four of these players, with the addition of Serge Ibaka, have reputations as fearsome defenders who similar sized and can easily switch between players when faced with screens, an important trait when facing motion offenses such as that of the Warriors and their own small-ball death lineup. Anunoby, Siakam, Fred Van Vleet, Delon Wright, and Kyle Lowry have held opponents to a lower field-goal percentage compared to their usual averages, highlighting just how much defensive potential the team has. Anunoby, being the primarily defender against the opponent’s best player every night last year, and Siakam, being able to defend and switch against all positions on the court, will improve with a year of defensive experience under their belt. During the preseason, the Raptors finished comfortably in the top 5 including opponent FG% allowed and defensive rating, showing indications that their defensive is able to once again rank among the top in the league, except with additional opportunities for locking down players on the perimeter.

<p>
At the very least, however, Leonard and Green will look to maintain their sterling defensive reputation throughout the regular season. In a preseason game against the Nets, both of them combined for 9 steals, with Kawhi netting 4 and Green taking 5. While it clearly remains to be seen whether their defensive productivity will continue to sustain for an entire season, both their personal histories and the Raptors’ plans for their defensive schemes this year all but point to the fact that Toronto will once again feature one of the best defenses in the NBA.
