                          <p>There are many players in the NBA that can pack a scoring punch. When we think of efficient scorers with lots of firepower, names like Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and James Harden come to mind. However, there are many other players that have shown the capabilities of being an elite scorer, but fail to do so consistently. JR Smith, Dion Waiters, and Lou Williams are some of these players that are well-known for providing an inconsistent spark of offense, but can still provide a lot of value to a team.</p>

                          <p>In the games where Williams missed his first field goal (11 of 15 games), he averaged 11.91 points, 2.36 assists, and 3.54 rebounds per game. However, in the four of the last fifteen games where Williams made his first shot, his numbers were a staggering 22.75 points, 3.25 assists, and 4 rebounds per game. Although this is a small sample size of information, a dramatic increase in production is reached when Williams nails his first shot attempt.</p>

                          <p>The mentality of a player is definitely an abstract concept, but from this small data set, it seems safe to say that Williams plays much better after gaining confidence after making his first field goal attempt. For Doc Rivers, his new coach, this could be valuable information in how he incorporates Williams into the lineup. I am not saying that Rivers should bench Williams after missing his first attempt, but rather to be wary of the minutes he gives Williams, considering whether or not he makes it or not.</p>
