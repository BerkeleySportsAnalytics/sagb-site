                          <p>
                            Each June, millions of captivated fans shift their eyes to the NBA Draft to
                            follow the myriad of ways that it could unfold. The beginning of the program
                            almost always delivers in magnitude and intrigue as lottery picks generate plenty of
                            buzz, mounting the stage with the promise of single handedly transforming broken
                            franchises into perpetual contenders. The next segment of the broadcast carries on
                            the excitement as the rest of the league makes its first selection. However, after 30
                            names have been called, many of us change the channel back to American Idol,
                            Jeopardy, or whatever else we had on before. What is the reason for this growing
                            phenomenon? It would make perfect sense if we were talking about baseball,
                            whose draft can go up to 40 rounds. But why the NBA? Well, for one, many
                            general managers have started to treat the 2nd round as nothing more than debris,
                            perplexing viewers with their capitulation of picks for mere “cash considerations.”
                            Thus, the apathetic attitude of fans toward Round 2 has ultimately reflected the
                            prevailing attitude of the the teams themselves. Nevertheless, the cash
                            considerations frenzy has only played a modest role in a much larger trend toward
                            the leveraging of current and future 2nd round picks for any assets teams that can
                            get, whether it be the money, players, or 1st round picks. In the 2018-2019 NBA
                            Season, 2nd round picks were dished out a grand total of 44 times, far surpassing
                            the 10 1st round picks traded over the same span. Since this strategy has never
                            garnered as much support as it has in recent years, I resolved to investigate its
                            merit in today’s game by quantifying the average value of each pick in the NBA
                            Draft, from the 1st overall pick to the 60th. After all, fans know that players as
                            prominent as Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, and DeAndre Jordan have seen their
                            names come off the board in the second half of the production. Are teams making
                            the right decision or passing up on perennial contributors? Using a statistic known
                            as Win Shares, which represent the number of wins that each player has accounted
                            for since he was drafted, I looked at the net achievement of each draft position over
                            the course of the last 30 drafts. The bar chart below summarizes the general decline
                            in mean and median Win Share values as the draft progresses.
                          </p>
                          <div>
                            <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/decoding-the-draft/bar1.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            The figure likely encapsulates what is to be expected— that is, a stepwise decrease
                            in relative value provided, with limited exceptions. Perhaps more expressive of a
                            gaping disparity, the bar graph below compares the mean and median Win Shares
                            between the first and second rounds.
                          </p>
                          <div>
                              <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/decoding-the-draft/bar2.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            Notably, over the last 30 years, 2nd round draft picks have rewarded their
                            respective teams with a median amount of Win Shares of approximately zero . That
                            essentially means that a given player selected in Round 2 has as good a likelihood
                            of not reaching the floor as he does of getting any minutes at all. This negligible
                            contribution helps to explain the broadening perception in front offices of the
                            second round as second rate. Moreover, the pie chart below augments this reality,
                            representing the overwhelming percentage of total Win Shares in the draft found in
                            the first round versus the second round.
                          </p>
                          <div>
                              <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/decoding-the-draft/pie1.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            If over 80% of the value in the draft is off the board by Pick 30, it becomes more
                            and more understandable why fans call it a night before Round 2 even begins.
                            Nevertheless, these visualizations do not tell the full story of the NBA Draft, and
                            further stratification of Win Share value proves to yield valuable insight:
                          </p>
                          <div>
                              <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/decoding-the-draft/pie2.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            Dividing the draft into 4 quadrants, one can observe the exceedingly high relative
                            value of mean Win Shares supplied by the first fifteen picks in comparison to the
                            rest of the draft. Corresponding roughly with the first hour of the draft, the lottery
                            picks, comprised of the first 14 selections made by teams that failed to reach the
                            playoffs, are shown to offer extreme value. In fact, over the course of the last 30
                            years, the lottery itself has accounted for more than half of the Win Shares of the
                            entire draft. Hence, the unmatched utility of a lottery pick serves to justify
                            emerging another trend seen across the NBA: the proliferation of tanking.
                          </p>
                          <div>
                              <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/decoding-the-draft/line1.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            Lastly, to provide a better sense of the degree to which the draft follows a course of
                            exponential decay (as well as an exponential loss of viewers), the line graph above
                            set next to an exponential trend line displays the exponentially depreciating value
                            of mean Win Shares available as each minute of the program passes.
