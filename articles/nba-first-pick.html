                            <h4>By Anoeil Odisho | January 30, 2018</h4>
                          </header>
                          <span class="image featured"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-first-pick/main.jpg"/></span>
                          <p>This offseason has been one of the most eventful in recent NBA memory. Notable NBA stars that defined their franchises left their teams for new opportunities. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony joined the Thunder after leaving the Pacers and the Knicks, respectively. Chris Paul left the Clippers to join the Rockets while Gordon Hayward decided to start a new journey with the Celtics. In the biggest trade of the offseason, Kyrie Irving left the Cavaliers to join the Celtics and play with Gordon Hayward, with Isaiah Thomas going in the opposite direction. The offseason was dominated by huge player moves, but also by one of the most exciting NBA drafts in recent memory.</p>
                          <p>This NBA draft was particularly notable, not only because of the loud antics of the Ball family, but also because of the huge potential running deep throughout the draft. This hype has been driving the rebuilding strategy for the Philadelphia 76ers, known as “the Process”. The team routinely traded away good players, tanked their team and had some of the worst NBA seasons in league history, with the hope that the high draft picks that would come from tanking would bring them the young best players available. So is the logic behind these trades sound? Is it worth sacrificing so much to get such high picks in the first round? In this article, we examine the average for Win Shares, career length, number of games, and points per game for each pick in the NBA Draft spanning from 1996 to 2010, a 10-year period. To help study the relationship between draft pick and average win share, we also categorize the picks by their major position.</p>
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-first-pick/graph1.png"/></span>
                          <p>Win Shares (WS) is a statistic that measures the influence of a player on their team’s number of wins and general success. On the graph on the above, the trend line for each position shows that, in the first round, guards and forwards routinely do much better than centers in the draft in terms of win shares. Additionally, there is a pretty steep downward trend from picks 1-15, with a smaller downward trend from picks 16-30. When it comes to the second round (picks 31-60), players are essentially the same when it comes to the number of wins they help their team get.</p>
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-first-pick/graph2.png"/></span>
                          <p>Furthermore, the graph on the above shows an almost linear relationship between draft pick and the average career length. When it comes to career length, it makes sense that higher draft picks would have longer careers, but what’s more interesting is that the second round picks have much more variation in career length, possibly because these players are inconsistent in their performance.</p>
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-first-pick/graph3.png"/></span>
                          <p>Finally, we look at points per game. There is an issue with this statistic, because guards and forwards are definitely going to have more points than centers on average since guards and forwards have the role of making 3-point shots, while centers stay in the paint and have a much stronger role on defense. But the visualization is still important, because like with Win Shares, there is a steep downward curve from picks 1-15, a much less steep downward trend for picks 16-30, and no apparent trend for picks 31-60. What’s particularly surprising is the clear partition in points between guards scoring the most, then forwards, and then centers scoring the least.</p>
                          <p>Through our NBA draft analysis, we have shown that there is a significant difference in the average number of win shares, average career length, and average points scored between players drafted in the first round. Tanking does make sense for teams desperately in need of superstar talent because a higher position in the first round is much more likely to generate a superstar. However, at a certain point, the benefits of a higher draft pick are marginal, in that there is still a lot of chance involved, and a higher pick does not always mean a more successful player that can win games. This is especially true when it comes to drafting players in the second round. In the second round, there is not much difference between the production of players drafted at the beginning of the round and players drafted at the end. One other important thing to notice from our NBA draft analysis is the importance of guards and forwards over centers. In the current era of basketball, centers are not nearly as valuable as guards or forwards, as shown in their career win share production. The main lesson of this draft analysis is that the next time we evaluate a team’s approach to tanking or evaluate trades involving draft picks, we should keep in mind the team’s overall objective regarding the level and type of player they are looking for.</p>

<h3><a href="#">The Winners and Losers from NHL's 3v3 Overtime System</a></h3>
<p>By Eric Herrmann | March 26, 2017</p>
</header>
<p>When a game goes to overtime in the NHL, the total number of skaters on the ice is cut down by four and the two teams play five minutes of 3-on-3 sudden death. The aim of the rule change was to cut down on boring, unfair and unpopular shootouts and increase the amount of overtime scoring to make that part of the game more fast paced and exciting. Halfway through the second season of its implementation, the question remains, has it achieved these aims or not?</p>
