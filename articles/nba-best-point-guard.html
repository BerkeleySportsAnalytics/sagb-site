                            <h2>The Best Point Guard</h2>
                            <h4>By Armaan Kohli | November 1, 2017</h4>
                          </header>
                          <span class="image featured"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-best-point-guard/main.jpg"/></span>
                          <p>A big debate throughout the years of the NBA has been about determining who the best point guard in the league is. Among the top players of this position, we have Russell Westbrook, who relentlessly attacks the basket to create openings for his teammates, James Harden, who orchestrates Houston’s fast paced offense by getting out in transition, Stephen Curry, who creates space for his teammates through his mere presence, John Wall, who opens up the court with his speed, and Chris Paul, who controls the offense with his excellent ball handling and court vision. However, it is very difficult to compare these point guards because of how they all perform their jobs as floor general differently. So, in order to provide a statistical basis to compare these guards, we will look at these players affected their team stats from the 2016-17 Regular Season in Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) and Offensive Rating (ORtg).</p>
                          <iframe height="400px" src="https://plot.ly/~armaankohli/4.embed?link=false&amp;modebar=false&amp;wmode=opaque" width="80%"></iframe>
                          <p>By looking at on and off court eFG%, we can see how the presence of these players help their teammates shoot the ball. All of these players improve their team’s eFG% when they are on the court. However, the degree to which they accomplish this differs. Although the top two MVP vote-getters from this past season, Russell Westbrook and James Harden, were both in the top three for assists last season, respectively, they created the lowest net increase in eFG% for their teams out of these five players. Looking at it by this metric, Stephen Curry is able to bring out the best in his teammates by increasing his team’s eFG% by about 7.2 percentage points, about 3 percentage points higher than the next highest player, Chris Paul.</p>
                          <iframe height="400px" src="https://plot.ly/~armaankohli/2.embed?link=false&amp;modebar=false" width="80%"></iframe>"
                          <p>However, it can be argued that shooting percentage is not the only thing that matters when determining the best point guard. So, we can also look at each player’s team’s on and off court ORtg, or a team’s points scored through 100 possessions. Despite the different measurement metric, we still see very similar results. James Harden, John Wall, and Russell Westbrook all improve their team’s oRtg the least between these five guards, Chris Paul comes in 2nd, and Stephen Curry comes in 1st by a sizeable margin. This time, Stephen Curry improves his team’s offensive rating by 17 points, 6 more than Chris Paul.</p>
                          <p>By looking at these metrics, it is evident that Stephen Curry was still the best point guard last season despite his drop in statistical production. Curry’s game relies on by making his teammates better and he was better at doing that than any other point guard last season.</p>

<h3><a href="#">The Winners and Losers from NHL's 3v3 Overtime System</a></h3>
<p>By Eric Herrmann | March 26, 2017</p>
</header>
<p>When a game goes to overtime in the NHL, the total number of skaters on the ice is cut down by four and the two teams play five minutes of 3-on-3 sudden death. The aim of the rule change was to cut down on boring, unfair and unpopular shootouts and increase the amount of overtime scoring to make that part of the game more fast paced and exciting. Halfway through the second season of its implementation, the question remains, has it achieved these aims or not?</p>
