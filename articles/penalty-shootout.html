                            <h4>By <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Gonzalo Pato</a> | March 28, 2022</h4>
                          </header>

                          <p>1 in 292.2 million. Or 0.0000003%. That amount is the odds that a lottery ticket of <i>Powerball </i>is the winning ticket1. The odds of getting killed by a cow is 1 in 300,0002 (which is even  higher than that of getting killed by a shark). But is there any way of influencing these  probabilities? Well, if you know that a cow can get you killed, it is better not to get close to  one. Or you can buy 2 tickets of lottery to double your chances (to 0.0000006%, so think  about the tradeoffs). </p>
<p>If we mention “the lottery” in soccer, most people will think of the same: <u>penalty shootouts</u>.  That time when advancing on the tournament (or even taking the cup home) is on the line.  Having already played for 120 minutes and everything tied up, the only way (and for people  with heart problems usually the least recommended) to end a soccer game is a penalty  shootout. Usually, it is said that penalty shootouts are a lottery… Or is there anything within  a team’s reach to increase the chances to win this “lottery”? </p>
<p><strong><u>Order of teams</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>After Spain’s loss in the 2020 Euros against Italy Gerard Piqué, former Spanish National  Team player, tweeted: “It is not chance that the four penalty shootouts that have been in  the @Euro2020 and the @CopaAmerica have been won by the team that shoots first.  Statistics say that the first [team] has more chances and in a tournament like this I don’t  think it is fair that a draw makes you start with a disadvantage”.</p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/2.png" alt="" /></span>
<p><u><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/3gerardpique/status/1412530382596083712?s%3D20%26t%3Dqw7eIyQJOW4&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1648609951562000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3GFjlgmEsUmZVR2wOo-J78" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/<wbr>3gerardpique/status/<wbr>1412530382596083712?s=20&amp;t=<wbr>qw7eIyQJOW4</a></u> <u>eMIumcc2_hA</u> </p>
<p>The draw that Piqué is talking about occurs in the previous moments of a penalty  shootout, in which two coin tosses occur: a first coin toss to decide in which goal the  penalty shootout will take place, and a second (and people argue that most important) to  decide which team will be shooting first. The captain that wins each coin toss is the one  who decides of each matter, so you have a 50% chance that your team kicks first. In such  case, team A, the team that shoots first, will always be followed by team B alternating  back and forth following this order: ABABABABAB… </p>
<p>According to Piqué’s claim (which is a shared belief by most people around the world),  having some “luck” can be differential in the outcome of the game. After having studied  262 penalty shootouts from the World Cups between 1982 and 20183,, the Euros 2020  and UEFA Champions League Finals after 20054, the international competitions at national  level, as well as the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and Conference League and  the top 5 national cups (England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France) in the last 3 years;  we can see that this advantage is not truly differential. </p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/3.png" alt="" /></span>
<p>Nevertheless, when restricting our analysis to when the home team plays (in the case of  international competitions, home is considered if it is organizing the competition) we can  see that the home team always has an advantage, no matter when it starts, although it  has a higher advantage whenever it is at home. </p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/home_away.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>‘Distribution of wins in penalty shootouts when the home team plays’** But is it really a matter of who starts first? </p>
<p>Taking a different approach to this analysis we can see what makes the difference: the  team that misses the first penalty is more likely to lose. In only 30% of the penalty  shootouts when both teams missed, the team that missed the first penalty won. On  average, on 52% of the penalty shootouts at least one penalty is missed by each team, so  it is likely that the team encounters this situation.</p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/4.png" alt="" /></span>
<p>One could argue that, knowing this, it is better to be the second team to shoot as the  other team will always be “one shot” ahead, nevertheless this is not completely true. In  general, team A misses in 74.4% of the penalty shootouts and team B misses in 77.5% of  them. Moreover, we can see how, when team B is the first to miss, their chances of  winning drops to 9.5%, whereas team A’s are only 20.4% when they are the first to miss,  so it is a clear sign that when a team is the first one missing it is nearly doomed to  elimination. </p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/miss_make.png" alt="" /></span>
<p>‘Distribution of wins in penalty shootouts by order of first penalty takers  depending on who misses first**  </p>
<p>Knowing all this makes it clear it is not only about who starts, but also about who starts  AND misses the first, so the next key thing is… how can a team be confident that, in the  likely event that it misses a penalty, does so after its opponent?  </p>
<p><strong><u>Order of penalty takers</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best penalty takers in soccer history. In the semifinals of the  2012 Euros, Cristiano Ronaldo wanted to take the fifth penalty to decide the outcome of  the game (as a matter of fact it was the 10th penalty of the series). Nevertheless, to his  surprise, he couldn’t take that penalty as the penalty shootout ended before that with the  Portuguese side going home and Spain advancing through to the finals (which would end  up winning). Four years later, in the UEFA Champions League Final, Cristiano Ronaldo used  the same strategy: he wanted to take the fifth and – supposedly – decisive penalty. In this  case, he got glory after scoring the final penalty of the shootout against Atlético de Madrid </p>
<p>and lifting Real Madrid to <i>La Undécima </i>in Zidane’s first season as a coach. It can be  understandable that CR7 wants to be decisive, he has always been, but there have been times that fate has not gone his way. Should he (and other top penalty takers) stick to this  strategy? </p>
<p>In general, the probability of making a penalty in a penalty shootout is of about 74.25%. If  we look at each round, it follows this trend, which would intuitively make sense for him to  shoot the fourth or fifth penalty, as it should counteract the effect of those rounds. Nevertheless, it would also make sense having your best penalty shooter taking the first  penalty, specially if you are team A, as you want to be the second to miss and it is when  team A misses the most. </p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/5.png" alt="" /></span>
<p>If we analyze the distribution of when each team usually finish the penalty shootouts, team  A more frequently finishes after the 5th penalty, whereas team B takes between 4 and 5,  yet it is not always certain to happen. So, it would be better to have Cristiano shoot before,  as he can be a changemaker.</p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/6.png" alt="" /></span>
<p>Moreover, continuing with the lines of argument of whether the team should shoot first  or second, recall that missing after the opponent increases the chances of scoring. After  studying when it is more prone a team to miss the first penalty, it is better to have the  best player to shoot the first penalties, as it is when the first miss usually occurs. </p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/7.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/8.png" alt="" /></span>

<p>Although this analysis leads to having the best penalty takers taking the first penalties, by  doing so the team would probably influence the numbers, specially of the first misses and </p>
<p>the probability of making the first penalty, so there may be cases when it may not be a  good idea after all. </p>
<p><strong><u>Directions of penalties</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>To finalize the analysis, it is important to focus on the direction of each penalty. Here the  sample size is reduced significantly to only the data from the World Cups between 1982  and 2018, the Euros 2020 and the UEFA Champions League Finals after 2005.  </p>
<p>If we divided the goal into 9 different zones ((x,y) tuples with 3 divisions per axis), the  general distribution of the shot location is the following: </p>
                            <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/9.png" alt="" /></span>

<p>We can see how players tend to shoot more towards the bottom corners, but it is not the  most efficient shots. When players aim towards the top right corner it is when they are  the most successful (and surprisingly it is where less shots are taken). We can see how  players tend to shoot less to the middle, which makes sense, as it will be easier for the  goalkeeper to save it. On the other hand, it could be argued that it is where the keeper  tends to stay less (only in 12.9% of the shots stays there), so it can be a good shot to take  it there even though it has the lowest probability of scoring (as it is probably due to the  sample size).</p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/10.png" alt="" /></span>

<p>Moreover, it can be seen how players that shoot to the right, regardless of its dominant  foot, tend to score more than players who shoot to the left, which coincides with the  graph above.  </p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/penalty-shootout/natural_side.png" alt="" /></span>

<p> ‘Probability of scoring when aiming towards its natural side (left footed to the  left and right footed to the right)’ </p>
<p>So, after all, to maximize the chances of winning this lottery, the team shooting first,  especially if it is at home, and has its best players shooting at the beginning of the  shootout towards the top right corner will be in a better position to win.</p>

                            <p>In the Bay Area, the trio of George Kittle, Brandon Aiyuk, and Deebo Samuel are aptly named the YAC Bro’s, referring to their ability to gain yards after the catch (YAC). No year has this moniker been more appropriate than the past 2021-22 NFL season, where the third member of the brotherhood accumulated 1405 receiving yards with more than half of that coming after the catch, en route to All Pro 1st-team honors and a Pro Bowl selection. </p>
