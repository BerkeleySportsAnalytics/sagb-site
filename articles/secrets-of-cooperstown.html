                          <p><b>Intro</b></p>
                          <p>Every year, millions of kids around the world head to their local baseball field, dreaming of one day playing in the big leagues in front of thousands of fans, just as their heroes do. However, their chances of getting there are slim. In the nearly 150 year history of Major League Baseball in the United States, only 20,787 people have been able to earn the title of “MLB Player”. Of these, only 274 players have made it into the Hall of Fame. Only the absolute best of the best get the call to Cooperstown. But, what exactly gets someone into the Hall of Fame? Although there currently exist several different voting committees which vote on eligible players under different circumstances, the majority of Hall of Famers are admitted through a ballot of about 307 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Voters are asked to vote for a maximum of 10 players from a list of around 30 eligible players every year, taking a holistic look at each player’s career. They are asked to consider things such as a player’s overall performance, clutch, leadership abilities, character, and achievements, both on a personal and on a team level. This has recently created debate over players from the Steroid Era, who despite being statistically some of the best players of all time, have had trouble being voted in. Despite this however, I was interested in taking a stats-first approach to see what sorts of numbers a player needs in their career in order to eventually be immortalized into baseball history.

                          <p>NBA Champion. NBA All-Star. The record-holder for most 3 pointers in a game. 37 points in a quarter. 60 points on 11 dribbles. Game 6 beast. These are all words that describe what has been an underrated career of Klay Thompson up to this point. Drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 2011, his accomplishments have been nothing short of amazing as he has continued to be loved and praised by DubNation. Yet, following the 2019 NBA Finals, I, along with hundreds of thousands of other Warrior fans, could not bear to relive the devastating moment in which he had attempted a dunk with Danny Green trailing. Falling and exerting enough force to tear his ACL - right away, this moment would be one that would crush, not only Thompson, but basketball fans all over the world. </p>
