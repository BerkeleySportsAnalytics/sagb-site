<p>
It is only Week 7 and the NFL is already off to a bang. There have been many captivating storylines thus far including the undefeated start of the high-flying Rams, the early impact of Khalil Mack on the Bears, and the emergence of Baker Mayfield and the Browns. However, perhaps the most notable breakthrough has been the unprecedented play of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Besides guiding his team to a 5-1 record, more impressive has been his personal achievement through the air, particularly in the first 3 weeks of the season. Throwing for a record-breaking 13 TD passes in that span, Mahomes eclipsed previous passing TD marks in Weeks 1-3 held by the likes of Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. Anytime someone breaks a record, you want to see if it means anything. That is exactly what I will do in this article, as I seek to project the trajectory of career outcomes for Mahomes. Given his immense and exciting potential as a 23-year old dual-threat quarterback with a big arm, it is only natural to look ahead into the future and speculate over just how successful “The Gunslinger” can be. Having played just 7 NFL games, Mahomes is obviously more limited than most in the degree to which he can be assessed from an analytical perspective. However, his historic streak of passing TDs to begin his career places him in good company, among an impressive number of Hall of Fame signal-callers. 
</p>

<p>
According to Pro Football Reference, this correlation between quarterback success in Weeks 1-3 and career success is surprisingly strong. For the purposes of this article, I will define “success in Weeks 1-3” as having thrown for 9 or more TDs during this span, something only 18 other quarterbacks have done throughout the history of the NFL. I will define “career success” as having been inducted into the Hall of Fame or being projected as a first-ballot HOFer (For the purposes of this study: Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees). Additionally, in order to determine if a streak of this nature has often been a fluke, I will look at those who are not members or projected members of the Hall of Fame and see if they have still been productive NFL quarterbacks, defining “career success” in this scenario as having had 3 or more Pro Bowl seasons. 
</p>

<div><span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/pat-mahomes-hof/graph1.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
The bar chart above depicts the varying career outcomes under this criteria among the 18 QBs who have passed for 9+ TDs in Weeks 1-3, ranked in ascending order starting with those with 9 at the bottom and going up to Mahomes’ total of 13, with the green bars representing “Hall of Fame”, yellow representing “3 or more Pro Bowls”, and red representing “Neither”.  
It can be seen that half of these quarterbacks have gone on to lead Hall of Fame careers. Conversely, only a small portion who have done what Mahomes has have disappointed in the NFL, as portrayed in the pie chart below.
</p>

<div><span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/pat-mahomes-hof/graph2.png"/></span>

</div>

<p>
The strength of this correlation is striking, especially when considering that some of the names of this list that were not classified as potential HOFers include those who still have a fighting chance in Philip Rivers, Carson Palmer, and possibly even Andrew Luck if we’re being extra optimistic. It would also not be unrealistic for Matthew Stafford to build on his 2014 Pro Bowl appearance and go on to reach 2 more Pro Bowls in his career, further decreasing the number of “disappointments” in Mahomes’ company. While it is has been shown that half of the quarterbacks who have thrown for 9 or more TD passes in Weeks 1-3 have been Hall of Fame caliber players, this correlation between Weeks 1-3 and the Hall of Fame becomes even stronger when looking at those who, like Mahomes, have accomplished this feat early in their career. 
</p>

<p>
On the list, the only other QB who has come close to matching the pace of Mahomes’ development in just his 2nd year in the league is none other than Dan Marino, who threw for 10 TDs in Weeks 1-3 of 1984 in his sophomore season with the Dolphins. Extending outward to those who have done so in their first three seasons in the NFL, accounting for the growing trend of starting newly drafted QBs earlier in their career, the number of signal-callers on the list grows and the tangible correlation with the Hall of Fame persists, as seen below:
</p>

<div><span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/pat-mahomes-hof/graph3.png"/></span>
</div>
  
<p>
Again, this correlation is on the conservative side as Stafford and Luck, both included here, each have the capacity to transcend their current designations, further bolstering Mahomes’ status as a 2nd-year superstar. 
</p>

<p>
You may be thinking, “You’re comparing Mahomes’ insane Week 1-3 total of 13 touchdowns to others’ measly total of 9, which is only an average of 3 TDs a game. Isn’t Mahomes really a tier above?” That’s true, and while that reality might be accounted for in the nature of today’s NFL as a passing league, nonetheless, it only augments his potential to not just match the production of these Hall of Famers but to transcend. Narrowing the list to only those with 10 or more TDs, the select group becomes even more elite (with the exception of a certain 2018 Ryan FitzMagic), including names such as Marino, Favre, Brady, and Manning, widely considered as top 10 quarterbacks to ever play the game. In addition, albeit with an increasingly small sample size, the correlation with the Hall of Fame becomes even more definitive.
</p>

<div><span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/pat-mahomes-hof/graph4.png"/></span>
</div>  

<p>
Overall, Mahomes’ record-breaking performance in Weeks 1-3 of the 2018 NFL season, across all visualizations, has linked him to a group of QBs out of which 50%-70% have Hall of Fame names: Manning, Brady, Favre, Marino, Elway, Brees, Namath, Kelly, Fouts. Maybe someday, this list will include the name Mahomes. Only time will tell.

                          <p>When a game goes to overtime in the NHL, the total number of skaters on the ice is cut down by four and the two teams play five minutes of 3-on-3 sudden death. The aim of the rule change was to cut down on boring, unfair and unpopular shootouts and increase the amount of overtime scoring to make that part of the game more fast paced and exciting. Halfway through the second season of its implementation, the question remains, has it achieved these aims or not?</p>
