Before the implementation of the one-and-done rule in professional basketball, exceptional high school players including LeBron James, Dwight Howard, and Kobe Bryant would skip college hoops and go directly to the NBA. Although these players had extraordinary NBA careers, not everyone who did this enjoyed the same success. Names such as Kwame Brown and Eddy Curry still make basketball fans cringe. Partly due to the these players turning out to be draft busts and partly due to business interests, an NBA committee ultimately passed the “one-and-done” rule in 2005, which essentially forced high school players to spend at least one year in college before declaring for the NBA draft. Since then, there have been a number of universities that have stood out with their quantity and quality of NBA-caliber players, many of whom choosing the one-and-done route. Viewing this situation from a player’s perspective, which university is the best choice in order to maximize the chances for professional success in the NBA?
</p>

<p>
From 2006 (the first draft that occurred after the one-and-done rule) to 2017, the universities with the largest number of players drafted are as follows: 
</p>

<p>
Based on the data, it is clear that the University of Kentucky has had the most success throughout the past decade in sending players to the NBA. However, although a good number of Kentucky players have developed into NBA stars including Anthony Davis, John Wall, and Demarcus Cousins, there are also many players who failed to remain on an NBA roster and make an impact. While the graph above illustrates quantity of players sent to the NBA, a better way to measure quality of players and overall player success is to look at where they were selected in the draft due to the correlation between draft position and on-court success.

<p>
In this comparison, both Duke and UNC have a higher percentage of their players being selected in the first round, thereby giving their players a greater chance to be better prepared to impact a team and earn more playing time. 
</p>

<p>
The final comparison measures player impact, and uses Win Shares/Games Played (WS/GP). Win Shares is a statistic that represents how many wins that player personally contributed to their team. Every game a team wins is roughly equivalent to 1 Win Share, with a 50-win team having 50 Win Shares to be distributed amongst all the players on the team based on how much the player statistically contributed to the win. WS/GP is then determined by the average Win Shares of all the players from each university divided the amount of games they’ve played. This serves to neutralize the fact that a player who plays and wins more games naturally has more Win Shares, and allows the average win shares of each universities players to be compared side-by-side:

</div>

<p>
Based on the data, NBA players who were drafted from Duke have the highest average WS/GP, meaning that they provide the largest positive impact to their teams, leading to more wins. It seems that while Kentucky provides the highest chance for a player to make it to the NBA, Duke provides a slightly higher likelihood of player success. Though Duke’s Coach K and Kentucky’s Calipari have a reputation for recruiting top talent, their programs consistently produce high-impact players in the league. As the NBA reformulates its relationship with the NCAA these numbers will likely shift, but during the first twelve years of one-and-done the evidence suggests these schools have offered athletes the clearest path to becoming effective NBA contributors.
