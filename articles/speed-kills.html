                          <p>
                            In recent years, the National Football League has undergone several drastic changes. Fans continue to 
                            crave high-scoring, dramatic offensive battles and resist a return to the gritty defenses of the past. 
                            Accordingly, it seems that the NFL has adjusted its rules to favor offenses. Quarterbacks are being 
                            protected by flags more than ever before it seems, with many controversial late hit or targeting penalties 
                            significantly alter many crucial games. Meanwhile, it appears that cornerbacks and safeties are hardly even 
                            allowed to touch opposing wide receivers, whereas wide receivers, on the other hand, are frequently getting 
                            away with so-called “pick plays,” where they allegedly unintentionally run into opposing defensive backs. 
                            NFL teams are embracing these structural changes. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Adopting these structural changes into their philosophies, quarterbacks are now soaring to the top of draft 
                            boards, even without world-breaking talent. Mediocre quarterbacks are being grossly overpaid (I’m definitely 
                            not looking at you, Kirk Cousins) while many defensive positions are being significantly devalued. Additionally, 
                            offensive coordinators have incorporated these paradigm shifts by prioritizing speed over power and attempting far 
                            more passes than runs. Receivers and running backs are expected to be even faster, and not necessarily as physically 
                            imposing, while offensive linemen are required to be more athletic. Defenses have responded accordingly to match the 
                            speed of offenses, by acquiring faster defenders and using sub-packages with more “hybrid” defenders who are more fast 
                            than physical.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Combined with fans preexisting affinity for speed (we love to dream of being fast as Flash and watching insane sprinters 
                            like Usain Bolt), the continued evolution of the game has elevated speed metrics to the top of fans’ interest. For many 
                            true fans, their anticipation for the upcoming season can spiral until the point where they have nothing better to do than 
                            watch the NFL combine (I must admit I usually watch the NFL combine despite telling myself I won’t, and I usually still come 
                            away disappointed). Watching the combine, it seems that everyone is hyper-focused on one marquee event: the 40-yard dash, a 
                            measure of a prospect’s straight-line speed. This event is particularly noteworthy for skill positions like wide receivers, 
                            running backs, tight ends, and defensive backs. Just recently, John Ross III broke the combine’s fastest ever 40-yard dash 
                            time with a blazing time of 4.22 seconds, and receiving prospect Henry Ruggs III of Alabama is expected to approach that time 
                            in this upcoming combine. Yet, after watching John Ross sputter for most of his young career as a receiver, it is fair to 
                            wonder how well 40-yard dash times and raw speed correlate to NFL success. Instead, I would like to examine a different metric, 
                            one which many scouts consider to be a better indicator of a prospect’s potential as an NFL receiver: the 3-cone drill, used 
                            primarily to measure quickness, fluidity, and agility. Looking only at wide receiver prospects who actually ended up playing 
                            in the NFL, I will examine how a prospect’s 3-cone time correlates to their immediate NFL success. I will measure success as a 
                            wide receiver’s receptions and receiving yardage in their rookie seasons from the past 5 years. A receiver’s success in their 
                            rookie season is a critical metric, as successful rookie receivers often have successful careers.
                          </p>
                          <div>
                            <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/speed-kills/scatter.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            The above analyses plotted over 100 rookie receivers receptions and yardage outputs vs their combine 3-cone time. For both scatter 
                            plots, the lines of best fit and extremely low R² values reveal that there is actually little correlation between a receiver’s 3-cone 
                            time and how well they perform in the NFL their rookie season. Even a cursory glance at some of today’s most notable receivers will 
                            highlight this result. For example, Odell Beckham Jr., one of the most explosive receivers in today’s NFL, ran a blazing 6.69 second 
                            3-cone drill that would corroborate the intuition that a good 3-cone time translates to NFL success. Conversely, DK Metcalf ran a very 
                            subpar 7.38 second 3-cone time, but has already had a very successful rookie season to date. On the opposite end of the spectrum, many 
                            prospects have run very fast 3-cone times and completely floundered in the NFL. Naturally, this all implies that it is unlikely a single 
                            combine metric can accurately predict the success of a receiver. A receiver’s success in the NFL is likely a product of numerous measurable 
                            and intangible factors, not just their speed or quickness individually. It sure would be a lot easier for scouts, however, if 3-cone times 
                            did predict success!
                          </p>
                          <p>Limitations:</p>
                          <p>
                            A couple of confounding factors must be noted. For one, this analysis doesn’t take minor injuries into account (major injuries resulted in 
                            a player being removed from this analysis, such as Colt’s Deon Cain), but injuries are obviously a big, sometimes unavoidable part of the game. 
                            Second, wide receiver’s are of course expected to have diverse skill sets and different teams draft players for different reasons. For some 
                            teams, a wide receiver may be drafted because they have very admirable raw skills, including 3-cone time, but aren’t expected to play right 
                            away. They are considered development projects. For other prospects, they are technically wide receiver’s but perhaps expected to primarily 
                            play on special teams. At the same time, though, this is part of what I am seeking to uncover in this analysis: whether a prospect’s 3-cone 
                            time can enable them to transcend expectations and perform well at the next level. To reiterate, it has been found that while a good 3-cone 
                            time is of course a beneficial quality, it cannot accurately predict a receiver’s success.
