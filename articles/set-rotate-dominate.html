                          <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of NCAA volleyball, the decision between running a 5-1
                            or 6-2 rotation can significantly shape a team’s offensive strategy and overall success. The 5-1
                            system, which relies on a single setter playing all six rotations, offers consistency in sets as well
                            as allowing for slide attacks and offensive setters to make front row attacks. Meanwhile, the 6-2
                            rotation, featuring two setters and always three front-row attackers, emphasizes versatility and
                            depth in offensive options. In this article, I’ll take a closer look at how these two rotations have
                            been deployed by five prominent teams in recent NCAA history. I’ll also dive into the past five
                            NCAA championships (Elite 8 teams from 2020 to 2024 predicted as of 11/11/24) to explore
                            how rotation choices have influenced the journey to victory, shedding light on the broader
                            strategic trends in the collegiate game. (side note: because the 2024 season has not finished yet, I
                            am using the top 8 ranked teams as of November 10, 2024)</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/set-rotate-dominate/5-1 6-2 Pie Chart.png"/></span>

                          <p>Over the past five seasons, I found that only 12.5% of Elite 8 teams have relied on the 6-2
                            system. This low adoption rate raises an interesting question: Why don’t more teams utilize the
                            6-2 rotation, especially when it seems to offer an offensive advantage by having three front-row
                            attackers at all times?</p>
                          
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/set-rotate-dominate/Offensive Defensive Stats by Rotation Type.png"/></span>

                          <p>Is 6-2 an inferior strategy in comparison to 5-1?</p>

                          <p>To investigate this, I compiled and analyzed data from the top teams in the NCAA,
                            comparing key stats like hitting percentage, kills per set, and blocks per set for teams using the 5-
                            1 and 6-2 rotations. The results offer fascinating insights into the relative strengths and
                            weaknesses of each system.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/set-rotate-dominate/HP by Team_Year with Average Line.png"/></span>

                          <p><b>Kills Per Set: The 5-1 Rotation's Edge</b></p>

                          <p>Teams using a 5-1 system consistently outperform 6-2 teams in terms of kills per set. The
                            average kills per set for 5-1 teams range from 13.5 to 15.5, while 6-2 teams average 12.1 to 13.0
                            kills per set. Despite the theoretical advantage of an extra front-row attacker in the 6-2 system,
                            the 5-1 system’s higher kill rates suggest that setter consistency may outweigh the benefit of
                            additional attackers. The lack of disruption in offensive rhythm from a single setter likely
                            contributes to more efficient offensive production, as evidenced by these higher kill rates.</p>
                          
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/set-rotate-dominate/Team Kills Per Set by Team_Year with Average Line.png"/></span>

                          <p><b>Hitting Efficiency: The Power of Consistency</b></p>

                          <p>The trend toward higher hitting percentages among 5-1 teams continues. Teams utilizing a 5-1
                            system see hitting percentages ranging from 0.24 to 0.36, whereas teams in the 6-2 system tend
                            to fall between 0.26 and 0.31. The consistent setting from a single player in the 5-1 system likely
                            contributes to better offensive flow and fewer attacking errors, allowing for more effective and
                            efficient offensive execution. This difference in efficiency underscores the importance of setter
                            consistency in achieving high hitting percentages.</p>
                          
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/set-rotate-dominate/Team Blocks Per Set by Team_Year with Average Line.png"/></span>

                          <p><b>Blocks Per Set: A Closer Look at Defensive Strength</b></p>

                          <p>On the defensive side, the data is more nuanced. Teams using the 6-2 rotation are competitive in
                            blocking, often outperforming their 5-1 counterparts in this area. The average blocks per set for
                            6-2 teams hover around 2.59, while 5-1 teams typically average 2.43 blocks per set. Interestingly,
                            both systems have seen an increase in block rates over the last five seasons, reflecting a broader
                            trend toward stronger defensive play across the board. While 6-2 teams’ depth in defensive
                            rotations may contribute to higher block numbers, the numbers suggest that blocking is not
                            necessarily a deciding factor in the choice of rotation system, as both systems perform well in
                            this area.</p>
                          
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/set-rotate-dominate/Assists Per Set Past 5 Seasons.png"/></span>
                          
                          <p>When comparing assists per set, 5-1 teams consistently generate between 10 and 12 assists per
                            set, while 6-2 teams typically have a range of 9 to 11 assists per set, with a noticeable variation
                            due to the presence of two setters. This variation in the 6-2 system may cause some inconsistency
                            in offensive execution, while the steady performance of a single setter in the 5-1 system provides
                            a more stable offensive platform. This consistency in setting likely explains why top teams might
                            prefer the 5-1 system.</p>

                          <p><b>Conclusive Strategic Implications</b></p>

                          <p>While the 6-2 rotation provides clear advantages in terms of physical recovery, mental benefits, and tactical
                            flexibility, the data indicates that the consistency and rhythm established by a 5-1 system still gives teams an edge at the highest levels of play. The 6-2 rotation allows setters to
                            rest during back-row rotations, reducing physical strain, especially during long tournaments. This
                            system also offers mental benefits, as setters can observe the game from the bench, receive
                            coaching during breaks, and reduce decision-making fatigue. On top of that, the tactical
                            flexibility of the 6-2 allows teams to tailor their offensive strategies based on opponent
                            matchups, creating built-in redundancy in the system with two setters. Despite these advantages, only 12.5% of teams in the Elite 8 have chosen a 6-2 system over the last five seasons,
                            suggesting that the additional depth may not be enough to overcome the advantages of
                            consistency.
                          </p>

                          <p>However, the flexibility of a 6-2 rotation becomes even more valuable in situations where a team
                            faces injuries to its primary setter. A prime example is Florida’s 2023 season, where the Gators
                            were forced to adjust their rotation due to the injury of star setter Alexis Stucky. In such a
                            scenario, the 6-2 system offers an immediate tactical advantage, providing a built-in contingency
                            plan that allows the team to continue running a fluid offense without the need for drastic system
                            overhauls. Having two setters in the rotation can help mitigate the loss of a key player, giving the
                            team the ability to continue executing offensive strategies with minimal disruption.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/set-rotate-dominate/0a1203fc-9093-4972-9739-440e23e9e9dd.sized-1000x1000.jpg"/></span>

                          <p>Wisconsin’s 2023 season serves as another powerful case study, showcasing how a team can
                            maximize its setter strength while mitigating traditional physical limitations. The Badgers’
                            setters—Izzy Ashburn (749 assists) and Sydney Hammill (564 assists)—demonstrated that
                            effective distribution and tactical awareness can offset any height disadvantages, leading to
                            impressive offensive results. Their success underscores the importance of building systems
                            around players' strengths, whether those systems rely on a 5-1 or 6-2 rotation.</p>

                          <p>Ultimately, the key to success in NCAA volleyball isn’t tied to the rotation system itself, but to
                            how well the system is tailored to the team's unique personnel and how effectively it's executed
                            on the court. The data suggests that, while the 6-2 system offers flexibility, depth, and potential
                            blocking advantages, the 5-1 rotation’s consistency remains the preferred choice for most Elite 8
                            teams due to its ability to maintain offensive flow and reduce errors. However, when faced with
                            unexpected circumstances such as injury to a key player, the adaptability of the 6-2 system may
                            offer teams the opportunity to weather the storm and continue competing at a high level. As we
                            look ahead to future seasons, this trend is likely to continue, though the versatility of the 6-2
                            system will undoubtedly continue to appeal to teams with specific needs or tactical goals.</p>

                          </a></h3>

                        <p>The 49ers offense has gotten off to a scorching start this season. They are averaging 30+ points a game right now and they are near the top of the league in most major statistical categories . They are littered with skill position talents from the dynamic Christian McCaffrey to Deebo Samuel , Brandon Aiyuk, and George Kittle . They have a quarterback in Brock Purdy who is like a point guard who knows how to get the ball to his playmakers . The offensive line finds a way to just open up running lanes and maul opposing defenses. And to top it all off, they have arguably the best play caller in the league in Kyle Shanahan who has an incredibly creative scheme and finds ways to get his players the ball in open space for them to wreak havoc.</p>
