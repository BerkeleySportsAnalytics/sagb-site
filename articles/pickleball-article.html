                          </header>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/main.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>Pickleball is America’s fastest growing sport, as well as the world’s fastest growing sport. I first heard about
                            pickleball when my sister and my dad played pickleball together during the previous winter break – they had
                            lots of fun and encouraged me to play as well. And in March, I attended the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics
                            Conference 2023, where there was a panel specifically dedicated to pickleball and how it was the world’s
                            fastest growing sport. At the conference, there was also a live Pickleball Open Play presented by the
                            Professional Pickleball Association (PPA). It was here that I learned more about the background and statistics
                            of this sport.</p>
                          <p>Invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island (Washington), pickleball was created as a way to pass time when three
                            dads and their kids were bored with their usual summertime activities. Since then, pickleball has involved into
                            a multinational popular sport, growing internationally to Europe and Asia. The explosion in popularity is due
                            to multiple factors – it’s easy to start playing and hard to stop, there are multiple facilities with pickleball
                            courts (found within YMCAs, PE classes, retirement communities, and community centers), is low impact, and
                            the pickleball court is easily convertible from existing tennis or badminton courts.</p>
                          <p>In this article, I will analyze data to discuss trends within pickleball and its popularity, and also analyze stats
                            between pickleball and tennis to decide which is likely to be the most popular racquet sport in the next years to
                            come. I will also discuss the Major League Pickleball (MLP) and Pro Pickleball League (PPL) and the stats
                            associated with each of these pro leagues.</p>
                          <p>Ultimately, I will answer the question: can pickleball maintain its moniker as America’s fastest-growing sport
                            over the next couple of years?</p>
                          <p><b>Pickleball: Taking Over the World?</b></p>
                          <p>Using data collected from the Sports and Fitness Industry Association’s (SFIA) Single Sport Participation
                            Report on Pickleball, I created these two charts. It is evident that the number of pickleball players has
                            increased exponentially over the past couple of years.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Pickleball Growth Charts.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>It is also important to note that pickleball growth increased substantially in 2020 (most likely due to COVID,
                            which brought the coming of new outdoor activities) and in 2022, which means that pickleball is still on an
                            upward trend. What’s also surprising to me is that pickleball grew more in 2022 than in 2020.</p>
                          <p>Also, seen from the Google Trends graph below, it is clear that increase in search entries for pickleball have
                            increased by a whopping 467% over the past 5 years (since 2018).</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Google Trends Pickleball.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>First of all, why is pickleball so popular? There are several different factors to potentially explain this. For one,
                            pickleball is a low-impact sport, which makes it popular among senior citizens as well as those who are injured
                            or cannot perform high intensity exercise. Many former tennis players have switched over to pickleball since it
                            is easier on their joints but still replicates similar movements. It is also very easy to learn.</p>
                          <p>One of the SSAC panelists, Jessie Irvine (Professional PPA player), reflects on the addictiveness of pickleball
                            due to its “neutralizing” effect – pickleball enables people of all different ages and genders to play together.
                            This builds a better sense of community within the sport.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Pickleball Players by Age.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>From this bar chart (created from data from USA Pickleball 2022 Fact Sheet) above, it is interesting to note
                            that the majority of core players last year were among the older generation. However, the majority of casual
                            players were in the 18 to 34 age bracket. This can provide some insight on popularity and “seriousness” of
                            competition in this sport. It is also interesting to note that the average age of pickleball players was 38.1 years
                            in 2021 and an average of 41.0 years in 2020. Following this trend, I can predict a rise in younger players over
                            the next couple of years.</p>
                          <p>According to the Pickleheads website (a blog on pickleball news and updates), California and Florida had the
                            highest number of pickleball courts in the US in 2021. I created a data visualization below to show this.
                            Additionally, according to the USA Pickleball Association (USAPA), the top 10 states in terms of USAPA
                            membership as of 2021 are: Florida, California, Arizona, Texas, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Oregon,
                            Michigan, and North Carolina.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Pickleball State Court Rankings.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>It's important to note that these rankings are based on USAPA membership, which may not accurately reflect
                            the total number of pickleball players in each state. Additionally, these numbers may be constantly changing as
                            more people become involved in the sport.</p>
                          <p>Also according to the USAPA, some of the regions in the US that have seen strong growth and interest in
                            pickleball in recent years include:</p>
                          <ul class="ul2">
                            <li>Pacific Northwest: The Pacific Northwest, which includes the states of Washington and Oregon, has
                              been a hotbed of pickleball interest and growth, with many top players and tournaments located in this
                              region. Since pickleball originated in Washington, the Pacific Northwest serves as a birth hub for this
                              sport.</li>
                            <li>Southwest: The Southwest, which includes states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada, has seen
                              significant growth in pickleball, particularly among retirees who have embraced the sport as a way to
                              stay active and social.</li>
                            <li>Southeast: The Southeast, which includes states such as Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, has also
                              seen strong growth in pickleball, due in part to its warm weather and large retiree population.</li>
                            <li>Midwest: The Midwest, which includes states such as Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, has also seen a
                              surge in pickleball interest and growth in recent years, with many new facilities and players emerging.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>To play pickleball, the equipment is quite minimal as well – you simply need a paddle, a ball, and (preferably)
                            a pickleball court (which is the same size as a badminton court). Not only is the equipment to play pickleball
                            minimal, it is also relatively cheap.</p>
                          <p>I also created a graph comparing the average prices of sports equipment for the six most popular racquet
                            sports. A key takeaway from this is that pickleball is in the middle of the price range – which means it
                            relatively affordable sport for most.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Screen Shot 2023-06-09 at 12.29.03 AM.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p><b>Pickleball vs. Tennis</b></p>
                          <p>Is pickleball overtaking the spot as the leading racquet sport in the US? From the graph below showing the  total number of pickleball vs tennis players in the United States over the last couple of years, it is evident that  pickleball is still lagging in popularity compared to tennis. However, with the consistent growth trend,  pickleball could potentially overtake the top spot.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Pickleball vs Tennis Total Players.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>From this graph, it is interesting to note that both tennis and pickleball grew in total number of players in 2020  – the most likely cause is the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            Another key aspect between tennis and pickleball is sheer size – you can fit up to four pickleball courts inside  one tennis court. This is shown in the figure below.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Pickleball vs Tennis Court.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>Something else to consider is the ranking system for each sport respectively. In tennis, players are ranked
                            based on a points system that adds up players’ 18 best results in the previous 52 weeks. In order to earn
                            ranking points, tennis players must participate in events hosted by the International Tennis Federation (ITF),
                            the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA). The number of points earned by the player depends on the round the player loses.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/WTA Rankings.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/ATP Rankings.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>In contrast, there are two ranking systems in pickleball - which causes confusion and can result in mismatches
                            between players at tournaments. The Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) prefers the DUPR (Dreamland
                            Universal Pickleball Rating) system, which tracks the outcomes of matches as reported by players. However,
                            the USA Pickleball Association (USAP) goes with the UTPR (USA Pickleball Tournament Player Ratings)
                            system, which tracks entirely different metrics that are not self-reported. Additionally, UTPR only tracks
                            tournaments sanctioned by USAP, disregarding any that are purely recreational.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/MLP Players.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>On top of these various differences, there are growing tensions between tennis and pickleball players.</p>
                          <p>One reason for potential tensions between pickleball and tennis is competition for court space and resources.
                            Both sports require a similar type of court, and as pickleball's popularity has grown, it has led to increased
                            demand for court time and space. This can create tensions with tennis players who may feel that their access to
                            courts is being limited or disrupted.</p>
                          <p>Another reason for potential tensions is the different cultures and demographics of the two sports. Tennis is
                            often seen as a more traditional and elitist sport, while pickleball has a reputation for being more inclusive and
                            accessible. This can create cultural differences between the two sports that may lead to tensions or
                            misunderstandings.</p>
                          <p>There have also been instances where pickleball courts have been built in close proximity to tennis courts,
                            which can lead to noise and other disturbances that may be disruptive to tennis players. This has sometimes
                            resulted in conflicts between the two groups.</p>
                          <p>Overall, while there may be tensions between pickleball and tennis, it's important to remember that both sports
                            have their own unique cultures and communities, and there is plenty of room for both to coexist and thrive.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/pickleball-article/Pickleball vs Tennis.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                          <p><b>Future of Pickleball</b></p>
                          <p>From these charts, I can foresee pickleball attracting much more players each year in the upcoming years - so
                            much so that I believe it may be a sport in the Olympics soon! Approaching 6 million players in the US alone,
                            pickleball has reached both national and international levels of play. Ultimately, the International Olympic
                            Committee (IOC) is the one who decides which sports will be included in the event. It must pass several
                            requirements, which include:</p>
                          <ul class="ul2">
                            <li>The sport needs to be regulated by an international non-governmental organization.</li>
                            <li>Next step is to ensure that the game follows the Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code. All players
                              must be found to be clean of performance-enhancing drugs.</li>
                            <li>The sport must meet a certain threshold of international popularity. (A potential Olympic sport must
                              be played in 75 countries across four continents if it is played by male athletes, or 40 countries across
                              three continents if played by female athletes.)</li>
                            <li>The sport must have adequate facilities.</li>
                            <li>The sport must have enough popularity around the world enough to gain viewer interest.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>As of now, pickleball has not reached all the criteria (yet), but it is a likely option to be added to the LA 2028
                            Summer Olympics – so keep an eye out for pickleball’s potential debut in the Olympics then! What’s
                            interesting to note is that there are some other very popular sports that are not in the Olympics with much more
                            players than pickleball – cricket (30 million players worldwide), squash (20 million players worldwide),
                            American football (5 million players worldwide), polo (500,000 players worldwide).</p>
                          <p>As for the general public, pickleball remains a fun and easy way to stay fit, as well as practice a low-impact
                            sport. Pickleball is a sport that can be played by all ages, doesn’t require much money to play, and will
                            entertain friends and family for hours – so don’t be afraid to give it a try!</p>
