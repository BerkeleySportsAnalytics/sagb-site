                            <h4>By <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Rohan Kathuria</a> | November 11, 2023</h4>

                          <p>With the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup underway, it is the perfect time to look into the
                            increasingly popular sport of cricket. Specifically, with all the talk regarding captains this year,
                            let’s look into how being captain affects a player’s performance.</p>


                          <p>Before I dig into data analysis and visualizations, as explained to me numerous times by almost
                            every person I have talked to here at Berkeley, most people do not know much about cricket so
                            let me give you a quick breakdown.</p>

                          <p><b><u>Setting the Context</u></b></p>

                          <p>If anyone has ever told you to think of cricket as an Indian version of baseball, I urge you to
                            forget about this statement and break off all ties with this person instantly. To begin, unlike most
                            sports here in the US, the biggest aspect of cricket is matches between countries and not clubs.
                            While there are club-based cricket leagues, such as the Indian Premier League, most
                            competitions are based on country, such as the current ODI World Cup which happens once
                            every 4 years.</p>

                          <p>If you have no idea what ODI is, don’t fret. ODI, or one-day international, is one of the 3 most
                            prevalent formats of the sport of cricket. Yep, there are 3 different formats. ODI gets its name
                            from the fact that one match typically lasts for one day or 8 hours, and it has 50 overs per inning
                            with 2 innings, so 100 overs total. An over entails 6 balls bowled by the same bowler. The
                            second format is a shorter one called T20, named after the fact that it has 2 innings with 20 overs
                            each. The last and oldest format is that of test cricket which entails 4 innings (2 per team) and
                            lasts for a maximum of 5 days. Importantly for this article, most countries have different teams
                            for different formats, often with different captains for all 3 formats.</p>

                          <p>If there is one thing that I want you to remember it is that we will be looking into captains’
                            performances across all 3 formats and we will be focusing primarily on matches between
                            countries and not clubs.</p>

                          <p><b><u>Performance Measures</u></b></p>

                          <p>Let’s now dive into some of the statistics that we will be using for this article. If you thought
                            your learning was over, boy are you wrong. But don’t worry, I’ll try and keep it as brief as
                            possible.</p>
                                                    
                          <p style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">
                            Let’s first understand the 2 key positions in the sport: <br>
                            1. Batsman: A batsman is someone who, well you guessed it, bats. It is their job to score
                            runs for their team as the team with the most runs wins the game. They can either take
                            runs, such as a single or double, by running in between the 2 wickets across a pitch or
                            score a boundary, a 4 or a 6, by hitting the ball outside the boundaries of the field. There
                            are typically 5-7 batsmen on a team.
                            <br>
                            2. Bowler: A bowler’s job, well you guessed it again, is to bowl. There are 2 types of
                            bowlers, spinners who try and rotate the ball to confuse the batsmen, and pacers who use
                            the velocity of the ball as a mechanism to get the batsmen out. The 4-6 bowlers in a team
                            aim to take wickets (get the players out) while defending the runs that their team has
                            scored. A batting side has 10 wickets—10 players who can get out—before they are
                            bowled out and stop batting. A bowler can get a batsman out in 3 main ways:
                            <br>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;"> a. Hitting the stumps/wickets: If a batsman misses and the ball hits the wicket, the batsman <br>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;">is out. </span>
                            <br>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;"> b. Getting caught out: If a batsman hits the ball and a fielder catches it before it
                            bounces, the batsman</span>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;">is out. </span>
                            <br>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;"> c. Leg Before Wicket (LBW): Well, you don’t need to know this right now, just
                            know that there is another <br>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;"></span>way for batsmen to get out and that if you drop the
                            phrase ‘I hate LBWs’ in a conversation with cricket <br>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;"></span>fanatics they will instantly love you. </span>
                            <br>
                            <span style="margin-left: 3em;"> <i>- Side Note: A batsman can also get run out but that is not pertinent to this article. </i></span>
                          </p>

                          <p>The picture below should put some of the phrases you’ve learned above in some more context.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/captain-clutch/Image 1.png"/></span>

                          <p style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">
                            Getting back on track, these are the key statistics we will be using: <br>

                            1. Batting Average: The total number of runs a player has scored divided by the total
                            number of times a player has been out <br>
                            2. Centuries: The number of centuries (100 runs or above) a player has scored. <br>
                            3. Wickets Taken: Total number of wickets taken by a bowler <br>
                            - The first 2 statistics are primarily for batsmen and the last one is primarily for bowlers.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>Below is a sample performance report looks like for both batsmen and bowlers from the recent
                            Asia Cup Final:</p>

                          <p>Now, as you eagerly wait for me to delve into the heart of the article, let me just explain why this
                            topic is so important. Unlike most sports where being captain has more of a sentimental value
                            than real value, in cricket it is vastly different. A captain plays a key role in selecting the players
                            of a team, deciding who bats when and who bowls when, and taking responsibility for the team’s
                            losses. Many big names in the sport, such as the all-time great Sachin Tendulkar, have not been
                            able to handle the ginormous pressure that comes with being a cricket captain of a country.</p>

                          <p>Hopefully, you now have a gist of why I am researching this topic, so let’s dive in.</p>

                          <p><b>Batsman Boost</b></p>

                          <p>While bowling is a key part of the game, after all, it is half the sport, historically most captains
                            have either been batsmen or all rounders. For instance, there is only one bowler captain at this
                            year’s World Cup (Aussie skipper Pat Cummins). We’re thus going to focus predominantly on
                            the impact of captaincy on batsmen, however, we will also briefly evaluate its impact on
                            bowling.</p>

                          <p>The batting average is considered to be the most important statistic for a batsman. Similar to
                            points per game in basketball or goals scored in soccer, the batting average is the easiest way to
                            quickly determine how good a batsman is. The higher the batting average, the more runs you
                            score and the better you are. However, unlike sports like basketball and soccer where you can
                            impact the game in different ways such as assists, scoring runs is the only thing a batsman can do
                            and so the batting average is even more important in some ways.</p>
                          
                          <p>If we analyze the batting average for captains before and after their captaincy as compared to
                            when they were captains, we get a graph like the one below.</p>
                            
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/captain-clutch/Image 4.png"/></span>

                          <p>On average, we can see that being captain leads to a player having a higher batting average.
                            Interestingly, we see that the batting average is higher for captains across a range of averages.
                            Based on the y-axis values, captains averaging lower scores, such as below 35 runs per game,
                            also improved their scores. This means that for both low-performing or below-average batsmen
                            and high-performing batsmen, there is typically a bump in batting average, clearly indicating a
                            positive relationship between becoming captain and scoring runs. While there are some
                            abnormalities, we can see a consistent pattern of improvement for captains. From this, we can
                            infer a wide array of things, such as batsmen improving under the pressure of captaincy or even
                            batsmen getting more play time after becoming captain which would help them. Both of these
                            are true for the case of Virat Kohli, who lies on the top right of the figure above and was known
                            for clutch chasing performances when he was captain. On the other hand, the slight
                            inconsistencies may also imply other effects of being captain. For instance, those who do not
                            cope well with the pressure or lose focus on their batting due to the extra responsibility have
                            performed worse during their captaincy. Coming back to Virat Kohli, he left his captaincy to
                            refocus on his batting and he is now performing exceptionally so we may see the orange line at
                            the top of the graph overtake the blue one.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/captain-clutch/Image 5.png"/></span>

                          <p>Our second graph shown above depicts the relationship between captaincy and the number of
                            centuries scored. A century is when a batsman scores 100 runs in a single inning—again,
                            reemphasizing the need to cut off your friend who told you cricket is like baseball. To understand
                            what a century means, imagine a more difficult version of a basketball triple-double or a slightly
                            easier version of a soccer hattrick. Again, similar to the batting average, on average we see a
                            boost in centuries scored while captain as compared to when a batsman was not captain. The
                            reasons for this, and the very few inconsistencies in the graph, could be due to the same reasons
                            described for the batting average.</p>
                            
                          <p>For the last batsman graphic, the image below from Amol Desai’s Medium article is a great
                            indicator of the varying impact that being captain has on one’s batting average.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/captain-clutch/Image 6.png"/></span>

                          <p>Unlike the earlier graphs which focused on captains at large, Desai’s figure gives a better
                            glimpse of specific instances of captains and their performances. We can see how some current
                            big names in cricket, such as Virat Kohli and Steve Smith improved significantly under
                            captaincy, while some legends of the sport such as Viv Richards and Michael Vaughan actually
                            had worse batting averages after becoming captain.</p>

                          <p><b>Wicket Wonder</b></p>

                          <p>Now that we have determined that captaincy has an average positive statistical impact on a
                            batsman’s performance, let’s see if the same stands for bowlers. While our dataset for bowling
                            captains is significantly smaller than that of batting captains, we can still analyze how being
                            captain affects the most important aspect of bowling: wickets.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/captain-clutch/Image 7.png"/></span>

                          <p>The figure above shows the relationship between wickets taken for captains as compared to not
                            being captain. While we do see a greater initial variation for wickets than batting average or
                            centuries, in general we can observe that there is a positive difference between wickets taken
                            under captaincy. Again, this may be linked with higher performance under pressure or more
                            consistent playing, among more factors.</p>
                          
                          <p><i>A quick interesting observation: </i>Do you see that our blue wickets curve (for captains) is a steep
                            incline at the end? That is to take into account former Pakistan captain Imran Khan (shown in the
                            image below), who shattered the test captain wicket record with 187 wickets. Even more
                            interestingly, you’ll also see Imran Khan’s name at the very top of Desai’s batting figure, above
                            names like Virat Kohli and Steve Smith, juist further highlighting the dominance of Pakistan’s
                            world cup winning captain. And if you’re wondering where you’ve heard the name Imran Khan,
                            what makes him somehow even more interesting is that he was the Prime Minister of Pakistan up
                            until last year!</p>

                          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

                          <p>Be it bowling or batting, if there is one thing that our analysis has told us it is that becoming
                            captain leads to players performing better on average. While we specifically know that batting
                            averages, centuries, and wickets improve during captaincy, this trend may also apply to other
                            performance statistics such as bowling economy and batting strike rate. The reasons for this
                            exact difference, however, can be extremely varied, such as the aforementioned pressure
                            performance and more consistent playing time.</p>

                        <p>Another great NFL season has just come to an end, which means that we are entering into a brand new NFL offseason and free agency is just around the corner. The Chiefs winning their 2nd superbowl in 4 years is in the rearview mirror and NFL teams are now gearing up to upgrade their teams to knock the defending champs off their throne next season. Free agency is a crucial part of the NFL offseason as teams have an opportunity to address key positions of need and take chances on players who didn’t work out with their teams due to contract disputes or declining skills. We’ve seen teams like the Bucs (Brady, Gronk, AB) go all in free agency and win Super Bowls and teams like the Eagles (AJ Brown, Reddick, Bradberry) retool their rosters to make massive turnarounds. Even the Chiefs made a lot of moves in free agency to replace departures like Tyreek Hill and Tyrann Mathieu (Juju, MVS, Justin Reid).</p>
