                            <h2>Premier League Summer Transfer Review</h2>
                            <h4>By <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Oliver Posner</a> | November 12, 2023</h4>
                          </header>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/main.png" alt="" /></span>
                          
                          <p>The 2022-2023 Premier League season was a long one, with Manchester City coming out as champions once again. Known as perennial spenders, interestingly, they did not have any of the top 5 most expensive transfers from the 2022 summer window. That belonged to Manchester United (2), Chelsea, Liverpool, and Newcastle United. This article will investigate these players’ impact on their respective clubs, both quantitatively and more subjectively. </p>
                        
                          <p><b>Antony</b></p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image7.png"/></span>

                          <p>The most expensive signing of the entire summer window, Manchester United spent €96 million to sign Antony from Dutch side Ajax. During the Premier League season, he appeared in only 25 out of 38 games, scoring 4 goals and assisting twice. To see his impact on Manchester United’s attack, let's take a look at the change in expected goals (xG) from the 2021/22 season to the 2022/23 season. </p>
                        
                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image10.png"/></span>

                          <p>Manchester United is depicted in green. As you can see, Man Utd’s xG increased from 21’ to 22’. However, so did a bunch of other teams. However, Manchester United also went from 6th place in 2021/22 to 3rd in 2022/23. To me, that is an indication that they were a better-attacking team, and although Antony himself didn’t have the best numbers, he certainly improved the team as a whole. </p>

                          <p><b>Wesley Fofana</b></p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image5.png"/></span>

                          <p>French defender Wesley Fofana joined Chelsea from Leicester City last summer for a reported fee of €80 million. This extremely high price for a 22-year-old has many wondering if he made an impact on Chelsea last season. Only appearing in 16 league games before tearing his ACL, fans were optimistic about Fofana. This is seen in the total number of shirt sales for Chelsea, increasing from 2021 to 2022. </p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image8.png"/></span>

                          <p>This huge increase in shirt sales was definitely influenced by their top summer signing. Furthermore, many Chelsea supporters are optimistic about the signing, given that he is a young player with plenty of potential. They also like his demeanor. Fofana tweeted two heart emojis in response to taunts when playing away at Leicester City. </p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image13.png"/></span>

                          <p>Chelsea fans loved his reaction, saying "This guy has the Chels DNA” and "loooool love players like this." Clearly, he has endeared himself to the fanbase and will be a popular player for years to come. In my book, even if he hasn’t been able to perform at his best on the field, this is a mark of a successful summer signing. </p>

                          <p><b>Darwin Nuñez</b></p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image1.png"/></span>

                          <p>Liverpool spent around €75 million to sign the Uruguayan striker from Benfica last June, looking to provide a difference up top from the aging Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané, both of whom have since left the club. As seen in the chart above, Liverpool’s xG decreased from the 2021/22 season to the 2022/23 season, but that’s not to say that Nuñez didn’t perform. He appeared in 29 of their 38 league games, scoring 9 times and assisting 3 times. Initially seen as a competitor to Manchester City signing Erling Haaland, he paled in comparison to the Norwegian and became infamous early in the season for missing easy chances. However, he is fitting in quite nicely in the team, especially with winger Mohammed Salah. Data from Opta shows that the duo created the most chances for each other out of any duo in the Premier League in the 2022/23 season.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image3.png"/></span>

                          <p>The duo is also off to a strong start this season, creating chances for each other every 29 minutes. This demonstrates how Nuñez has adapted to his new role on the team. He had a tough start to his Liverpool career, but expect a better season this year, especially as he and Salah are able to continue to build their chemistry. I think it’s a great signing for Liverpool.</p>

                          <p><b>Casemiro</b></p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image4.png"/></span>

                          <p>Manchester United spent around €80 million to sign the 30-year-old defensive midfielder from Real Madrid last summer. He’s certainly made his mark in Manchester. He appeared in 28 games for the Red Devils, shoring up a midfield that needed some experience. He helped bring down Manchester United’s expected goals against (xGA) from 2021/22 to 2022/23.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image12.png"/></span>

                          <p>He helped Manchester United be one of only 6 teams that had a decrease in xGA between the two seasons. However, he missed 7 Premier League matches last season due to 2 red cards and an accumulation of yellow cards. He had as many red cards last season as he did in 9 years at Real Madrid. I believe that when he can stay on the pitch, Casemiro is one of last summer’s best signings, helping solidify Manchester United. </p>

                          <p><b>Alexander Isak </b></p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image2.png"/></span>

                          <p>Signed for €70 million from Real Sociedad last summer, Newcastle’s new ownership spent big on the young Swede. Appearing in 22 Premier League matches, Isak scored 10 and assisted 2. He helped the Magpies go from 11th in 2021/22 to 4th and a Champions League spot in 2022/23. In his first season, he helped Newcastle increase their expected goals from 40 to nearly 80.</p>

                          <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image9.png"/></span>

                          <p>Along with powering Newcastle to the Champions League for the first time since the 2003/04 season, Isak has also become popular with the Magpie fanbase. He has drawn comparisons to legendary striker Alan Shearer, especially after his Champions League injury against PSG.</p>

                          <div class="row-article">
                            <div class="column-article">
                              <img src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image6.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
                            </div>
                            <div class="column-article">
                              <img src="../images/dj-pics/premier-league-transfers/image11.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
                            </div>
                          </div>

                          <p>He has charmed the Newcastle fanbase and reinvigorated support in the club. He will be someone to watch in the next few years, especially with Newcastle’s new Saudi owners pouring money into the club.</p>

                          <p>Each of these 5 players have had an impact on their club, but to a Manchester United fan like myself, it seems as if Casemiro has had the greatest impact. However, Isak and Nuñez are beginning their careers and tearing up the league so far. Keep an eye out for them. </p>

                          <p>By Aakash Adhia | April 16, 2023</p>
                        </header>
                        <p>Another great NFL season has just come to an end, which means that we are entering into a brand new NFL offseason and free agency is just around the corner. The Chiefs winning their 2nd superbowl in 4 years is in the rearview mirror and NFL teams are now gearing up to upgrade their teams to knock the defending champs off their throne next season. Free agency is a crucial part of the NFL offseason as teams have an opportunity to address key positions of need and take chances on players who didn’t work out with their teams due to contract disputes or declining skills. We’ve seen teams like the Bucs (Brady, Gronk, AB) go all in free agency and win Super Bowls and teams like the Eagles (AJ Brown, Reddick, Bradberry) retool their rosters to make massive turnarounds. Even the Chiefs made a lot of moves in free agency to replace departures like Tyreek Hill and Tyrann Mathieu (Juju, MVS, Justin Reid).</p>
