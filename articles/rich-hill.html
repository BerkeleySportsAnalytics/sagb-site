                            <h4>By Matthew Duston | February 27, 2019 </h4>

                         <p>
The 2018 World Series was full of forgettable moments for the Dodgers, but none more than their late inning collapse in game 4, as the bullpen gave up nine runs in three innings to all but eliminate the Dodgers from the World Series. The collapse was made even worse by the choices made to get to that point, as manager Dave Roberts removed starting pitcher Rich Hill in the middle of the 6th, while he still had a one-hitter. This move was crucified by fans all over the internet, as even the president let his opinion of the move be known. But, despite the massive criticism, Robert’s move to take Hill out wasn’t innately a bad move, and follows suit with a growing trend in the MLB - the reduced role of the starting pitcher.
</p>

<p>
Conventional logic tells us that, if a pitcher is doing well, “cruising” through his outing, he should continue to “cruise” and perform, and in game 4, many expected Rich Hill’s performance to continue through the sixth and beyond. However, looking at Rich Hill’s performance in his regular starts, this isn’t necessarily the case.
</p>

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/rich-hill/graph1.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
The graph compares how Hill’s ERA during the first two times through the order compares with his performance through the third, and shows that there is no correlation. In fact, the trend line even suggests that expected performance third time through the order gets better as performance through the first two times gets worse, however this is likely due to pitcher’s getting removed earlier the worse of a start they have. Still, the data shows that no matter how well a pitcher does early on in a game, they still have as much a chance to do poorly and give up runs as if they were having a poor start, and that performance early in a game is not predictive of performance in the later innings.
</p>

<p>
Which takes us back to game 4 of the World Series. There may not have been any guarantee that Rich Hill continues to shut down the Red Sox, but was the bullpen any more trustworthy? In hindsight maybe not, but going in, there was no reason to expect the Dodgers bullpen to implode. This year, the Dodgers owned the 8th best bullpen in the league with a 3.72 ERA, and had been excellent going into the World Series, with a bullpen ERA of 1.38 through the NLDS and NLCS. Going to the bullpen early was also part of a new trend, as in the 2018 postseason, more and more teams pulled their starters earlier to rely more on strong bullpens. Ace relievers like Josh Hader and Blake Treinen were brought in during critical moments in the middle innings, and stayed in to lock down several scoreless innings. Teams in the playoffs were using good relievers more and more often, as they realized how much more reliable relievers are than starters in critical, high leverage situations. Take a look at the WPA/IP versus LI for relievers versus starters in the World Series this year.
</p>

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/rich-hill/graph3.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
WPA/IP represents the average amount of wins that a pitcher’s performance added per inning, while LI represents the average situation a pitcher was in that inning, with higher values corresponding to more crucial points in a game. For starters, there is essentially no correlation, as the long number of innings means that when and if they blow up has no relation to  LI. For relievers, however, there is a clear correlation, as the best relievers in high leverage situations performed significantly better on average. There are many tactical advantages to relievers, as short outings allow relievers to have some of the nastiest “stuff” in the game. Factors like these are a large reason why teams have learned that in tough situations, it is much safer to put in an ace reliever than hope a starting pitcher will fight through, and survive to face more hitters in a situation that gets more precarious with each inning pitched.
</p>

<p>
Relievers have the potential to be great weapons for a team, coming in during the latter parts of a game to save the starting pitcher, and shut down the opposing team. However, no matter how good the pitcher, sometimes it all goes wrong. Mariano Rivera, considered by many to be the greatest relief pitcher of all time, still blew 11% of his saves, including 5 out of 47 save opportunities in the postseason. Most of the time, the bleeding can be stopped through pitching changes and platoon advantages, but sometimes, as happened in game 4, things take a turn for the worse.
</p>
  
<p>
As soon as Hill was pulled from the game, six different Dodger pitchers gave up a combined 9 runs in 3 innings, including 5 in the 9th, for a combined ERA of 27.00 in a very uncharacteristic look for the Dodger bullpen. In the whole 2018 season, a team’s bullpen gave up 5 or more runs in an inning in only 2% of games, the Dodgers only doing so 5 times. The Dodgers had also never lost a game while leading by 4 or more runs this season, going 54-0 through the regular season. This choke job came out nowhere for the Dodgers, as their performance puts them with historic company. Here are the most runs given up in the last 3 innings of World Series games since 1903, the year of the first World Series.
</p>

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/rich-hill/graph4.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
Out of the 115 World Series that have been played since 1903, there are only 4 other teams who gave up as many runs in the last 3 innings of a game as the Dodgers in 2018, and of those teams, only 2 others were from the modern era. The performance of the bullpen in game 4 was historically bad, and wasn’t due to a simple bad decision - most of the Dodger’s best relievers were put in, and all contributed to the collapse. Whether due to a historically good Red Sox team, or simple luck, the magnitude of the Dodger’s collapse was by no means to be expected, and extremely unlikely. 
</p>

<p>
Despite the historic nature of game 4, this sequence of events doesn’t mean that the demise of the starting pitcher is overstated, or that good bullpens aren’t as important in the postseason. In fact, it only highlights their importance in this era of high powered offenses, as strong, reliable relievers give even more of an advantage against even average bullpens. Despite some high profile failures, relievers should continue to be used more and more, as front offices put more emphasis on the bullpen while preparing for the playoffs.
