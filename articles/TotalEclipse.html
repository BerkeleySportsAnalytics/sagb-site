                            <h2>The Total Eclipse has Arrived</h2>
                            <h4>By <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Kian Naini</a> | May 15, 2024</h4>
                          </header>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/TotalEclipse/Thumbnail.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>Victor Wembanyama’s arrival to the NBA was greeted with mystical fanfare. Heralded as
                            the best draft prospect since LeBron James, yet most fans had never watched him play a game in
                            full length due to Wembanyama playing all of his games in the French league. All we had to go
                            on was this idea of a player reminiscent of an NBA 2K created player: a 7’4” big man that could
                            handle and shoot like a guard, finish over anyone with his height, and rebound and protect the
                            rim like his countryman Rudy Gobert. The NBA has seen remarkably tall players before, with
                            names like Yao Ming, Manute Bol, and Ralph Sampson coming to mind. However, none of these
                            guys have had the fluidity of motion or the perimeter game that Wemby possesses. How the
                            Spurs are using him is unprecedented, and has the potential to become a complete game-breaker
                            if Wembanyama reaches his full potential.</p>
                          
                          <p>Simply put, guys that are Wembanyama’s size just don’t attempt three-point shots as
                            often as he does. Among players 7’2” and above, his three-point attempt rate is only rivaled by
                            Luke Kornet, Kristaps Porzingis, and Bol Bol in all of NBA history. It is noteworthy that all of
                            these players are part of the modern NBA, likely a reflection of the emphasis placed on spacing
                            and shooting in the last ten years.</p>
                          
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/TotalEclipse/Career Three Point.png" alt="" /></span>

                          <p>Wembanyama’s overall three-point volume is dramatically higher than every player on
                            the above chart except for Porzingis. Wembanyama and Porzingis are the only two players above
                            7’2” in NBA history with more than five three-point attempts per game. However, the quality
                            and type of shots each is taking is drastically different. Porzingis relies exclusively on
                            catch-and-shoot threes, centering on pick-and-pop actions. Wembanyama creates his shots off of
                            pull-ups and multiple dribbles much more than Porzingis, which are higher difficulty shots than
                            standstill catch-and-shoot threes.</p>
                          
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/TotalEclipse/Three Point Shot.png" alt="" /></span>

                          <p>Put it all together, and we’ve essentially never seen a player at Wembanyama’s size shoot
                            this many threes at this level of difficulty. What’s even more impressive is the fact that he’s not
                            only taking these shots, but he’s also making these shots. He shot 37.5% on pull-up threes and
                            46.2% on step-back threes. That 46.2% clip was the highest in the entire NBA among players
                            with at least 50 three-point attempts. Interestingly, he shot just 28.3% on catch-and-shoot threes,
                            but it stands to reason that this efficiency will increase in the future due to his solid mechanics
                            and adeptness at shooting more difficult shots. When that happens, it may be truly impossible to
                            guard Victor Wembanyama.</p>
                          
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/TotalEclipse/Career Usage Rate.png" alt="" /></span>

                          <p>In addition to his three-point prowess, Wemby has also been featured in the Spurs offense
                            at an unparalleled rate among both players of a similar age and/or similar stature. At a 32.2%
                            usage rate, Wembanyama had the highest usage rate among any qualified rookie in NBA history,
                            and already the second-highest rate among all seven-footers all-time, trailing only Joel Embiid.
                            Usage rate is a metric that aims to quantify the percentage of his team’s possessions a player uses
                            while they are on the court. Higher usage rates correlate to players who are directly involved in
                            their team’s offensive actions more. In the modern NBA, high usage rates often come from
                            ball-dominant guards. Wembanyama’s massive usage rate shows he, like Embiid, is being used
                            as a heliocentric initiator of the offense. Setting aside youth, this is even more ridiculous when
                            you consider that other seven-footers who have posted massive usage rates like Embiid and
                            Shaquille O’Neal often do a lot of their work from the post, an area Wembanyama does not
                            frequent as often. Part of the reason for this massive usage rate is that, unlike many other centers
                            in history, Wembanyama is also shouldering a large playmaking burden. His assist percentage of
                            21.5% is already the highest career assist percentage among any seven-footer ever.</p>
                          
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/TotalEclipse/REB vs AST.png" alt="" /></span>

                          <p>For about half the season, the Spurs decided to play without a true starting point guard, opting
                            instead to start point forward Jeremy Sochan at the point guard position with their best point
                            guard, Tre Jones, coming off the bench. Jones entered the starting lineup in January, and
                            Wemby’s averages shot up from 18.9 PTS, 10.3 REB, and 3.0 AST before January to 22.7 PTS,
                            11.4 REB, and 5.0 AST from there on. There is some natural rookie growth that has to be taken
                            into account as Wemby grew accustomed to the NBA, however, Jones also made Wembanyama’s
                            life slightly easier with his playmaking ability. The Spurs’ five best lineups by plus/minus all
                            featured some combination with Jones and Wembanyama, and just the two-man combination was
                            
                            by far the best pairing with a net of +5.1 points. The fact that Wembayama put up the outstanding
                            averages he did despite his team handicapping him for half the season should make other teams
                            extremely anxious as to what could happen if the Spurs upgrade at point guard in the offseason
                            through trade or the draft.</p>
                          
                          <p>In addition to his offensive prowess, Wembanyama also led the entire league in blocks
                            with 3.6 per game and will likely finish second in Defensive Player of the Year voting, a
                            remarkable achievement for a rookie. The 3.6 BLK was the highest single season average since
                            Serge Ibaka in the 2011-2012 season, and Wembanyama also had the most combined steals plus
                            blocks this season. In many ways, the rim protection ability is a direct consequence of his
                            freakish combination of size and length. Yet his ability to move in space at his ridiculous frame
                            gives him the ability to switch onto perimeter players, a vital skill in the modern NBA where
                            many defensive coverages are predicated upon players being able to guard multiple matchups. It
                            is likely only a matter of time before he wins multiple DPOYs.</p>

                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/TotalEclipse/Three Point Made.png" alt="" /></span>

                          <p>Upon signing his shoe deal, Nike marketed Wemby as the alien. Taking into account his
                            shooting, playmaking, overall scoring ability, and defense, it stands to reason that Wemby
                            entering his prime will truly be the dawn of the extraterrestrial among normal NBA players. The
                            NBA 2K demigod casual NBA fans pictured when Wembanyama was drafted may just become a
                            reality.</p>

                        <p>The 49ers offense has gotten off to a scorching start this season. They are averaging 30+ points a game right now and they are near the top of the league in most major statistical categories . They are littered with skill position talents from the dynamic Christian McCaffrey to Deebo Samuel , Brandon Aiyuk, and George Kittle . They have a quarterback in Brock Purdy who is like a point guard who knows how to get the ball to his playmakers . The offensive line finds a way to just open up running lanes and maul opposing defenses. And to top it all off, they have arguably the best play caller in the league in Kyle Shanahan who has an incredibly creative scheme and finds ways to get his players the ball in open space for them to wreak havoc.</p>
