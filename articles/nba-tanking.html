                            <h2>How Bad Has Tanking Gotten?</h2>
                            <h4>By Daniel Waldman | January 29, 2018</h4>
                          </header>
                          <span class="image featured"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/main.jpg"/></span>
                          <p>One does not have to look far to see the effects of what is seen as increased tanking on the NBA over the last few years. Tanking, deliberately losing in order to either keep an insufficiently protected draft pick or just to improve a team’s draft position, has taken an increased role in criticism of the league. The Philadelphia 76ers and GM Sam Hinkie, after a disastrous trade for C Andrew Bynum in 2013, embarked upon a strategy that became the high-profile, worst-kept secret in the league: they would intentionally lose, indefinitely, in order to hopefully amass the collection of affordable, homegrown superstars integral to all modern championship teams.</p>
                          <p>The strategy predates Hinkie’s 76ers. In 1997, the Spurs and Celtics famously waged a late-season tanking duel to land the rights of Tim Duncan, whose selection by the Spurs indelibly changed the history of both franchises. In 2003, the Cleveland Cavaliers staged a similarly pathetic asset sell-off in order to win the right to draft LeBron James, and the 2012 Warriors publicly joined the fray with a putrid 3-17 finish allowing them to keep their top-7 protected draft pick, which became Harrison Barnes. However, Hinkie’s brutally economically-sound strategy, taking the concept of tanking to the nth degree changed the culture surrounding the NBA fundamentally. Though Hinkie was fired in April 2016, mere months before the 2016-17 76ers began to showcase the promise of future contention, Hinkieite thinking has taken an increasingly prominent role in NBA thought.</p>
                          <iframe height="400px" src="https://trends.google.com/trends/embed/explore/TIMESERIES?req=%7B%22comparisonItem%22%3A%5B%7B%22keyword%22%3A%22nba%20tanking%22%2C%22geo%22%3A%22%22%2C%22time%22%3A%222004-01-01%202017-11-05%22%7D%5D%2C%22category%22%3A0%2C%22property%22%3A%22%22%7D&amp;tz=420&amp;eq=date%3D2004-01-01%202017-11-05%26q%3Dnba%2520tanking" width="100%"></iframe>
                          <p>The graph above shows how the popularity of tanking in the NBA since Hinkie’s 2013 hiring has jumped massively. “In Hinkie we trust” and “Trust the Process” became a mantra for an entire fanbase, and the development of C Joel Embiid has been heralded as Hinkie’s process coming to fruition. You can even play an interactive <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/1/24/16036704/tanking-the-game-5f5524ec589d#.o80fuubs2" target="_blank">game</a> wherein the goal is to replenish a mediocre franchise with draft picks and superstars.</p>
                          <p>The crux of Hinkie’s philosophy relies on the basic conclusion that an NBA season without a championship is worthless. Therefore, a team’s goal should be to win championships, either in the present or the future. Consequently, any season spent rudderless and talentless in the vast stable of mediocre NBA franchises is a wasted season, unless that team has a concrete plan to become a championship team. For most franchises, the model for escaping the dregs of the NBA has historically been building through either free agency or the draft. However, in the modern NBA, as championship-caliber superstars increasingly seem to value championships over money, it is nearly impossible to attract a superstar without one on the roster already.</p>
                          <p>Thus, according to Hinkie, it all boils back down to the draft. Though the unique-to-the-NBA draft lottery of the 14 non-playoff teams was recently tweaked to discourage sustained losing, , Hinkie and his disciples see the gamble as worth taking. Superstars in the NBA are so few and far between that, in order to win a championship, teams must be lucky to begin with. Therefore, any chance at drafting an affordable young future star is well worth the risk for a team set on winning. Hinkie’s 76ers and the example they have set so scare the league that, in addition to the aforementioned reforms some within the NBA have allegedly been said to be considering more drastic reforms such as the end to the lottery because of the detrimental effect tanking has had on the league.</p>
                          <p>A natural question that may arise, then, is how bad has tanking really gotten? Are middling teams that, in a simpler time, would compete and play hard all for lower playoff seeds now recognizing their Sisyphean problem and giving up midseason all to improve their draft odds? If this is happening, how bad has it gotten? It’s tough to measure the relative confidence and effort level of a locker room over the course of the season, but we can look at the Win/Loss records of teams during the season and see how they change on average once teams are eliminated from the playoffs, or come reasonably close to doing so. A team behaving rationally, according to Hinkie, would start intentionally losing as soon as it realized it had no chance of winning a championship that year.</p>
                          <p>As a reasonable proxy for this change in strategy, we can look particularly at teams’ winning percentages before and after an arbitrary late-season date wherein, according to Hinkie, losing becomes the rational strategy. I chose the periods before and after March 1 of a given season as a good enough approximation of when this change in strategy would normally occur, and looked at how the strategies of the bottom 20 teams in the league on March 1 of a given year changed over time. Below are the differences between pre-March 1 winning percentages and post-March 1 winning percentages for every bottom-20 team in the NBA since 2007. If a large trend towards tanking exists over the last decade, we should see the differences rise over time (remember, the “difference” here is the pre-March 1 winning percentage minus the post-March 1 winning percentage, so a higher difference value suggests the team performed worse over the last quarter of the season relative to their performance in the first three quarters).</p>
                          <span class="image half-left"><img alt="" height="241.25px" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/graph1.png"/></span>
                          <span class="image half-right"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/graph2.png"/></span>
                          <p>Whatever trend exists clearly has not been a wholesale move towards late-season tanking by the bottom two-thirds of the league. While some years have been “tankier” than others, looking at the bottom 20 as individual data points doesn’t reveal much in terms of a large-scale trend towards tanking.</p>
                          <p>What if we looked at the average differences each year instead of the individual data points? If a league-wide trend really exists, it would likely be reflected in an increase in the bottom 20 teams’ average differences. The averages for each year are plotted above, but don’t indicate much either.</p>

                          <p>If anything, the average differences indicate a trend away from tanking, but it’s important to keep in mind that this result does not tell us much - these 20 teams make up two-thirds of the league, so on any given day multiple are likely playing against each other. Players want to win and fans want to win, so it makes sense that not all of these teams can tank at the same time. Indeed, the average differences are all very close to 0. The biggest average difference, 2013’s .011%, is equivalent to swinging roughly 3 games of the roughly 300 played between March 1 and the end of the season, and probably attributable to random chance.</p>

                          <p>So maybe there hasn’t been a league-wide movement towards tanking, but it’s reasonable to think that it might just be confined to a small subset of teams. Perhaps the biggest offenders are the true bottom-feeders, the teams with the 21st to 30th best records in basketball. These are the hopeless franchises, the ones that know they aren’t making the playoffs. Surely they have the greatest incentive to tank, yet the evidence doesn’t seem to show much of a movement towards tanking among the bottom third of the league.</p>
                          <span class="image half-left"><img alt="" height="242.55px" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/graph3.png"/></span>
                          <span class="image half-right"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/graph4.png"/></span>
                          <p>Just as in the previous case, deviations from 0 difference between pre- and post-March 1 records are small when they exist, and show a miniscule trend towards tanking over the last decade. Clearly, though, whatever trend towards tanking that might exist hasn’t done much intensifying throughout the last two years in this group of teams.</p>
                          <p>It’s possible that this is just a problem on our end - maybe we’re just looking at the wrong teams. After all, the bottom-dwellers of the NBA either were, post-Hinkie, tanking away the whole season, or were actually trying to win ballgames and simply the worst teams at it. Either way, it doesn’t seem likely that a team in either situation would play much worse at the end of the season than at the beginning. If anyone should be tanking, according to pro-tanking arguments, it’s those teams that aren’t horrible but just mediocre. I isolated the teams with the 17th-to-25th-best records on March 1, the eight teams with the best records that weren’t in playoff position, curious to see if any tanking effect was limited to that group. As shown above, that wasn’t exactly the case.</p>
                          <p>If anything, this group showed a trend away from tanking over the last decade. In 2015, teams with the 17th-to-25th best winning percentages on March 1 increased their winning percentages, on average, by 10%. This means that the average mediocre NBA franchise actually won about 2 more games of the last 20 than they could have expected to if their previous winning percentage was any indication of their future performance. In other words, not only have these teams not turned to tanking over time as a solution to their franchises’ woes, they’ve actually gotten even better as the season goes on, and have gotten better by more almost every year.</p>
                          <p>This revelation is especially stark when considering the group of teams slightly better than these teams - the 15th to 20th best teams in the league on a given March 1. These teams could be Hinkie’s prime targets, and indeed the 2013 76ers that he took over had the 20th-best record in the league. Yet these teams, as it turns out, tank even less than their slightly worse counterparts.</p>
                          <span class="image half-left"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/graph5.png"/></span>
                          <p>A clearly visible trend exists when we look at this subset of teams, but it isn’t in the direction Hinkie says is rational. Indeed, not only have these teams increased their last-quarter winning percentages over time, they’ve done it at a consistent rate specifically since Hinkie’s ideas made their well-publicized debut.</p>
                          <p>What exactly is going on here? We’ve looked at teams Sam Hinkie would tell to immediately tank, yet ever since he became GM of the 76ers they’ve either stuck with their old strategies or decided to try even harder during the games that help their franchise least to win. All the while, it seems like everyone notices that tanking has gotten worse in the league recently.</p>
                          <p>The missing piece here shows that one of the assumptions made earlier was probably incorrect. Earlier, when we posited that the teams that just recently turned to tanking probably weren’t the worst teams to begin with, we overlooked what became the culprit all along: that teams that were already horrible at basketball would find ways to get even worse. A bad basketball team wins maybe 25% of the games it plays. When it really wants to, though, it can channel its inner 2012 Warriors, who, as mentioned above, were right below .500 before ripping off a stretch of .150 winning percentage basketball. As it turns out, the teams with the lowest ceilings had very low floors that the turn to tanking has forced them to increasingly test. The 2012 Warriors made history for being the first team to ever start a lineup entirely composed of rookies, which it used to start its final game of the season. Below are the differences in winning percentages before and after March 1, for both the 26th-30th and 28th-30th best teams in the league. The lower the team’s spot in the standings, the farther they are willing to fall for favorable lottery luck. The effect of tanking is clearly evident for the bottom five teams in the league.</p>
                          <span class="image half-left"><img alt="" height="249.16px" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/graph6.png"/></span>
                          <span class="image half-right"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-tanking/graph7.png"/></span>
                          <p>Coming up on five years since Sam Hinkie kicked off in earnest the tanking revolution, the cataclysmic change in strategy some believe to be inevitable for all non-superstar team has yet to take its hold just yet. In fact, outside of the true bottom-feeders of the league, it seems to have barely had any effect at all.</p>

<h3><a href="#">The Winners and Losers from NHL's 3v3 Overtime System</a></h3>
<p>By Eric Herrmann | March 26, 2017</p>
</header>
<p>When a game goes to overtime in the NHL, the total number of skaters on the ice is cut down by four and the two teams play five minutes of 3-on-3 sudden death. The aim of the rule change was to cut down on boring, unfair and unpopular shootouts and increase the amount of overtime scoring to make that part of the game more fast paced and exciting. Halfway through the second season of its implementation, the question remains, has it achieved these aims or not?</p>
