                          <p>
                            This year’s Duke basketball team was ranked as the top team early in the season and carried that
                            rank into the NCAA tournament. However, the Blue Devils faltered throughout March Madness
                            and ended up bowing out to Michigan State in the national quarterfinals. Was the 2018-19 Duke
                            team really deserving of the “best Duke team” and “could beat the Cavaliers” label?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Let’s compare Duke’s regular season to that of the national champions over the past ten years
                            (with two of those being the 2010 and 2015 Duke teams).
                          </p>
                          <div>
                            <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/greatest-duke-team/bar1.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            Five out of the ten had all these characteristics going into the tournament, and the only teams not
                            to have four or greater were the 2010-11 and 2013-14 Connecticut championship teams. In
                            addition, 2011-12 Kentucky’s senior guard Darius Miles averaged 9.9 points, nearly completing
                            the perfect 10-of-10 for that aspect of the chart. In addition, 2018-19 Duke had by far the lowest
                            3 point percentage rank, entering the tournament at 329th, while none of the ten champions were
                            outside of the top 300 and six of them inside the top 50 (with 2018-19 Virginia as #1 and
                            2017-18 Villanova as #2).
                          </p>
                          <div>
                              <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/greatest-duke-team/ranks.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            Against these characteristics, this year’s Duke team only stacked up to recent champions in terms
                            of SRS (simple rating system, which takes into account strength of schedule and average point
                            differential). A high relative SRS indicates that Duke was a talented, winning team, but a poor
                            performance in March Madness may be attributed to a lack of overall experience, lesser
                            offensive efficiency, and higher turnovers.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Coach Krzyzewski has headed many memorable Blue Devil squads, but some experts touted this
                            as the best yet. We can compare these metrics for the last three championship Duke teams that
                            have reached the national finals under Coach K, to gauge the ability of this year’s edition.
                          </p>
                          <div>
                            <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/greatest-duke-team/metrics.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            The Duke teams fill all the metrics listed above, save for the 2000-01 Blue Devil’s need for an
                            upperclassman guard in double figures (although senior forward Shane Battier averaged nearly
                            20 ppg).
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We can also compare the SRS against the nine Blue Devil teams Kryzyzewski has taken to the
                            finals.
                          </p>
                          <div>
                            <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/greatest-duke-team/bar2.jpg"/></span>
                          </div>
                          <p>
                            Although this year’s Duke team had a high relative SRS, it was not exceptional compared to the
                            other finals-qualifying squads, ranking third out of 10, and a point over the average of 25.69.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Overall, the 2018-19 Duke Blue Devils had a strong regular season team, finishing as ACC
                            Champions and seeing the breakout of likely number one overall NBA draft pick Zion
                            Williamson. However, they did not show signs of a “championship” team, like Virginia did.
                            Their flaws, from high turnovers to poor shooting percentages, doomed them in the tournament,
                            as they snuck past close games against UCF and Virginia Tech before falling to Michigan State
                            in the regional finals.
