Do diminishing marginal returns exist in the NBA? Does there exist a point at which too much talent on one team is actually detrimental to that team’s success? Plenty of teams in the past have been loaded with all-star and MVP level talent, but the Golden State Warriors are the first team in the history of the league with all 5 starters being selected to the all-star team at some point in their careers. When Kevin Durant first announced his move to the Warriors, the public reaction was overwhelmingly negative. Cries of “he made the league unfair” and “I’m never watching the NBA again” filled social media within a matter of hours. But did KD actually make the Warriors worse? After all, there is only one basketball to go around, and every possession that Kevin Durant controls the ball is one less opportunity for Steph Curry and/or Klay Thompson impact the game with their own top-tier skill sets. 
</p>

<p>
To analyze this question, we have to look at the Warriors’ statistics with and without Durant. Prior to Kevin Durant, the Warriors were a free-flowing offense without a single selfish instinct. All players were only concerned with getting the best possible shot for every possession, and simply were unconcerned with points per game, assists, rebounds, etc. It was the epitome of team basketball. However, Kevin Durant is by nature an isolation player, and as someone who performs best when he has plenty of time to break down a defender, he naturally takes some time away from his teammates. This can be shown by a graph demonstrating average touches per game for each player on the Warriors before and after KD. 
</p>

<span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/nba-kd-team/graph1.png"/></span>

<p>
The entire team has struggled in the wake of Kevin Durant joining the Warriors. Since Durant’s arrival, the Warriors’ key players have taken significant steps back in their scoring output. This is evidenced in the points per game graph since 2015:
</p>

<p>
Almost all of the players are getting fewer touches and consequently scoring less. However, as can be seen in the visualization, Curry has clearly been most impacted by this. As a rhythm shooter, Curry requires a high number of touches to find his 3 point shot on a consistent basis. It’s definitely not surprising to see that some of Kevin Durant’s best games have come at Curry’s expense.  During the Christmas day game against the Cavaliers in 2016, Kevin Durant had an incredible game with 36 points and 15 rebounds, whereas Curry merely scored 11 points on 4-11 shooting. Steph was being used as a decoy/screener to get Durant the ball, which is shocking given the fact that Curry is a superstar in his own right and won back to back MVP awards in the previous years. However, he was relegated to Durant’s sidekick in high stakes match-ups with playoff level competition. During the same season, when KD was out with an injury, Steph had his best stretch, scoring 27.5 PPG and 8.2 APG along with an unreal 50.4 shooting percentage from three point range. Having Kevin Durant in the mix simply did not work for an offense that was so accustomed to fluid ball movement and individual selflessness. With KD on the team, both Klay and Steph’s shooting percentages initially went down to sub-optimal levels, and virtually all the starters’ shooting percentages declined.

One might point to the dominance of the Warriors in the playoffs as proof that the Warriors are better with Kevin Durant. However, there is a crucial distinction to make here. Because the Warriors simply have more star-power, they are able to rest certain starters (like Steph and Klay) while still playing Durant, who still happens to be one of the greatest scorers the game has ever seen. Thus, the Warriors can keep a superstar in the game against other teams’ bench players, and it is obvious who will come out on top in that stretch of the game. Overpowering your opponent is not synonymous with playing “better” basketball. If the benchmark for the Warriors being a superior team is not winning more games or even winning a championship, it may be improvements in efficiency/style of play. With KD, the Warriors have clearly become less efficient, as almost all important players on the team have had diminished on-off court values (which measures a player’s overall productivity) since Durant’s arrival. Moreover, the Warriors’ defensive rating has gone up from 103.5 in 2015, to 104 in 2016, to 107.6 in 2017 (the higher the defensive rating, worse the team’s overall defense is).
</p>

<p>
The true way to judge if the Warriors are better with Durant or not is to see the performance of the team when all starters are on the floor at the same time. In these instances, it is clear to see that the chemistry and the fluidity that the team had during their record breaking 73 win season is just not there. With only one ball to go around, the Warriors are stretched too thin with the collection of talent that they have on their roster. When players are unaware of what their role on the team is (as is the case between Curry and Durant), it leads to confusion and lower quality of play. Eventually, the individual that used to be your X-factor, strongest weapon, and MVP (Curry) becomes a shell of his former self, and the entire offense loses its momentum and resorts to isolation basketball. The Warriors, unfortunately, are simply not better with Kevin Durant.
