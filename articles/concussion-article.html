                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/concussion-article/main.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>Concussions are the most common sports injury. According to University of Michigan Health, about 3.8 million concussions occur each year in the U.S. from sports-related and recreational injuries. Additionally, 20% of high school players experience a concussion in a given season.</p>
                          <p>But what exactly is a concussion?</p>
                          <p>The best way to explain a concussion is to imagine your head as a snow globe. Now imagine  violently shaking the snow globe so that the snow inside is disrupted and swirls all around.  Analogous to the snow, your brain will take time for the contents to settle down from the impact  force to the head.</p>
                          <p>Concussions in athletes are extremely common – these brain injuries can occur due to a blow,  jolt, or bump to the head or body, as well as if the head or body is shaken violently. Concussions  affect cognitive functions, such as memorizing vocab for English class, focusing during work,  and even remembering simple daily tasks. Many athletes can also develop post-concussion  syndrome (PCD), which is when concussion symptoms last beyond the expected recovery period for the initial sustained injury.</p>
                          <p>In this article, I will discuss the various statistics involved with concussions, as well as various  athletes who have endured concussions.</p>

                          <p><strong>Which sports have the most concussions?</strong></p>
                          <p>he sports with the most concussions are contact sports - sports that emphasize or require  physical contact between players.</p>
                          <p>The bar chart below shows concussion rates – this indicates the number of sports concussions  taking place per 100,000 athletic exposures (AE). An athletic exposure is defined as one athlete  participating in one organized high school athletic practice or competition, regardless of the  amount of time played.</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/concussion-article/bar chart.png" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>Looking at the bar chart, it is apparent that football has the most concussions. This is not a  surprise, considering that a pro football player will receive an estimated 900 to 1,500 blows to  the head per season. The average pro football player Hockey, soccer, lacrosse, and basketball are  also high up on the list (all contact sports).</p>
                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/concussion-article/football.webp" alt="" /></span>
                          <p>Some important mentions that are not on this bar graph are rugby, boxing, and taekwondo.  Rugby is actually ranked even higher than football, making it the sport with the largest number of concussions. Hand-to-hand combat sports such as boxing, taekwondo, and other martial arts  also have a high concussion rate (due to the high amount of kicks and blows delivered to the body).</p>

                          <p>Interestingly, there is actually evidence that female athletes are more prone to concussion than  males. Female athletes are not only more susceptible to concussion than are males, but also  sustain more-severe concussions. Why is this?</p>
