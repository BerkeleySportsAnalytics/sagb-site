                          <p>
                          So, let’s talk about the 2017 Giants.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          What happened?

                          A team glimmering with potential. A rotation with two aces set to dazzle the National League. An offense lead by Buster Posey, Brandon Belt, Brandon Crawford, and... Madison Bumgarner, I guess?
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          It's well-known that the Giants offense is floundering. They're dead last in OPS and wRC+, and 28th or lower in batting average and OBP. This team is absolutely atrocious when it comes to most offensive categories. That's been a well-established fact accepted by just about everyone.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          Also well-known is the struggling starting pitching. For a team that's built almost entirely on strong pitching and defense, this just can't happen. Even just using traditional stats, you can see how much Giants pitchers struggle. As a team, Giants pitchers have a 4.54 ERA, which is around league average (the Reds are at the bottom with a 5.27 team ERA). This is largely because Madison Bumgarner, the Giants ace, decided to fall off a dirt bike in April and miss a few months. Johnny Cueto became the front end of the pitching staff, and he has been struggling with blisters all season (darned Juiced Balls™). 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          So, the pitching isn’t really the biggest source of their struggles. Well, let's just look at a lineup from a random old day in the season. How about, say, May 28th? Nothing special about it. Here was the lineup:
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          That's a pretty normal-looking starting lineup. One could be so bold as to say a good starting lineup. All the mainstays are there--Belt, Posey, Crawford, Panik. Well, almost all of them; Pence is not there. Who the heck is Justin Ruggiano? Well, Pence was out with a hamstring injury, which Giants fans have noted as a problem associated with Pence. Last year, Pence slashed .289/.357/.451, good for a .808 OPS and 120 wRC+ (a statistic computed by Fangraphs which measures how valuable a player is offensively compared to the league average of 100). He was a big part of San Francisco's lineup last year, worth 3.8 WAR. This year, so far, he's slashed .248/.304/.364, which, as you can tell, is significantly worse (a .688 OPS). He had a similar slash line back in May.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          That being said, Justin Ruggiano has performed at an even lower level. This year, he played 19 games for San Francisco, and he slashed .217/.238/.333, for a .571 OPS. Even with Pence struggling, that's an OPS differential of .117, which is huge. Pence's other substitute, Mac Williamson, is a player who comes in and out of the minor leagues and will generally substitute in for injured outfielders. So far this year, he has a .643 OPS, which is good by the 2017 Giants standard, but it's still a differential of .045 OPS.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          My hypothesis, then, is that the Giants have struggled largely due to a lack of depth--when their best players go down, they don’t have anyone who can contribute in the same way. Bench players in general just aren’t as good as starters, but when the entire bench is atrocious, it can be a huge problem for a team. So let’s just look at a simple table comparing OPS of starters to OPS of bench players for the Giants. For simplicity, we’re going to treat Eduardo Nunez as the Giants’ starting third baseman, even though he was traded. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          I’m using Baseball Reference as reference for starters on the Giants, so Austin Slater (left fielder) is the only case where the bench player has a better OPS than the starter (Left Field was a platoon position for the Giants this year). The Giants have an average OPS differential (Starter OPS - Bench OPS) of a whopping .107 (which, in case you were confused, is not very good at all). 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          Let’s do the same analysis for the Dodgers, who are division rivals to the Giants and finished with the best record in baseball.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          These graphs don’t look all that dissimilar, and I think a lot of that has to do with the Dodgers making good use of utility player Kike Hernandez, who provides a lot of value solely in his ability to play multiple positions but also can produce relatively well offensively. One thing that stands out is that there are more small bars closer to the baseline. This means that there’s a significant difference in average OPS differential (i.e. Starter OPS - Bench OPS). For the Dodgers, the average OPS differential is only .095, compared to the Giants’ .107. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          I expected the Giants’ OPS differential to be significantly larger, but this analysis is a bit problematic, because it only roughly measures overall offensive production and not overall value. In addition, the Dodgers have two arguably MVP-level players on their team inflating their differentials in Justin Turner and Corey Seager. Luckily, there’s a statistic that measures overall value, both defensive and offensive--it’s called WAR--Wins Above Replacement, or, how many wins a player contributes compared to a player that can be “replaced” with no negative effect on the team. Generally, a starter should have 2.0 WAR, an All-Star should have 5.0 WAR, and an MVP should have above 8.0. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          We can perform then, this same analysis with WAR, and our results are pretty different.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          In this case, I’ve included the WAR for bench players in orange because looking at WAR requires context, especially if we’re comparing two wildly different teams like this (to put it simply, the Dodgers’ best players are much, much better than the Giants’). 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          The Dodgers bench certainly isn’t perfect, but the contributions are consistent and pretty significant considering that starters, obviously, get more play time. One striking difference is that there was literally no difference in the contribution between the bench and starting catchers. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          That is what depth looks like, and that’s a big reason why the Dodgers were successful. There are many striking differences in the graphs above--one obvious one being that the Giants bench barely contributed, which is especially terrible since the Giants starters dealt with injuries all year (except Buster Posey at catcher). When your bench players are worth more wins, the team will do better overall because the team can adapt to different situations with ease. I think just looking at the striking difference between the best and worst teams in baseball tells you a lot. If we compared the Dodgers to, say, the Cubs, who are currently battling it out in the NLCS, we probably wouldn’t see very many differences here. This isn’t exactly a grand revelation--it’s more or less common sense that having a better bench makes your team better, but it’s incredible what can be revealed just by looking at data and understanding why the bench matters.
                          </p>

<h3><a href="#">The Winners and Losers from NHL's 3v3 Overtime System</a></h3>
<p>By Eric Herrmann | March 26, 2017</p>
</header>
<p>When a game goes to overtime in the NHL, the total number of skaters on the ice is cut down by four and the two teams play five minutes of 3-on-3 sudden death. The aim of the rule change was to cut down on boring, unfair and unpopular shootouts and increase the amount of overtime scoring to make that part of the game more fast paced and exciting. Halfway through the second season of its implementation, the question remains, has it achieved these aims or not?</p>
