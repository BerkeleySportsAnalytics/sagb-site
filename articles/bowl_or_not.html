                          <p>Always bowl first. That’s a phrase my dad has heard and rolled his eyes at more times
                            than he can count in the last few years. As a kid growing up in India, my dad listened on the
                            radio to lots of cricket commentary. When I started high school, I finally agreed to watch a game
                            with him, and have loved it ever since. Naturally, I have been a fan of the Indian national cricket
                            team since then. I’ve followed hundreds of exciting matches full of thrilling wickets and tight
                            chases, but if you ask my dad, he’d say I am most nervous for the toss. So why do I say “always
                            bowl first” before every match? I would say I’m only half-joking. Every knowledgeable cricket
                            fan knows that the toss is a crucial part of any cricket match. Depending on the weather
                            conditions, the nature of the pitch, and other factors, making the right choice of batting or
                            bowling first can give a huge advantage to the team winning the toss. Therefore, always bowling
                            first is not the smartest idea by any means.</p>

                          <p>However, I have always thought that the Indian national team has the best bowling attack
                            in the world. Though I may be partial, the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, and
                            Ravindra Jadeja form a truly formidable opposition. I am always more at ease when India bowls
                            first not only because of the star-studded lineup, but also because it allows the batters to
                            understand how to go about their overs. Having a total to chase means having a starting point and
                            a reference. Having been able to watch how the ball behaves on that particular surface allows the
                            batters to plan their approach. In my mind that is immensely valuable, but I wanted to see if the
                            data does bear this out. I used ESPNcricinfo’s cricket data to examine this question.</p>

                          <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/bowl_or_not/Picture2.png" alt="" /></span>

                          <p>The chart above shows the Indian cricket team’s wins and losses based on the toss
                            outcome across all ODI matches. Overall, the team did better when they bowled first regardless
                            of whether they won the toss or not. This is interesting because winning the toss is usually an
                            automatic advantage, sometimes large and sometimes small. The fact that the Indian team
                            performed better when losing the toss and fielding than when winning the toss and batting is
                            therefore curious. Next, I looked at how the Indian team performed in different locations.</p>

                            <div class="row-article">
                              <div class="column-article">
                                <img src="../images/dj-pics/bowl_or_not/Picture3.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
                              </div>
                              <div class="column-article">
                                <img src="../images/dj-pics/bowl_or_not/Picture4.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
                              </div>
                            </div>
                            <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/bowl_or_not/Picture5.png" alt="" /></span>

                            <p>The graphs above show that in home and away games the Indian team performed much
                              better bowling first regardless of whether they won the toss or not. However, in neutral games
                              this phenomenon was much less pronounced. In fact, in neutral games, which comprise mostly of
                              world cups and other international competitions, the differences in the win loss proportions based
                              on toss outcomes were quite negligible. From the above distributions, it seems that the Indian
                              team tends to do better when bowling first even when they lose the toss. I wanted to see if this
                              trend was noticeable for other top international cricket teams. I chose to look at Australia’s
                              games as they have been a dominant team over the years.</p>

                            <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/bowl_or_not/Picture6.png" alt="" /></span>

                            <p>The Australian team’s distribution looks very different to the one of the Indian team. As
                              the graph shows above, Australia has done extremely well when they won the toss and batted but
                              not done very well when they won the toss and fielded first. This is essentially the opposite of
                              the Indian team. Therefore, India’s trends do not match that of another highly rated team.</p>

                            <span class="image featured"><img src="../images/dj-pics/bowl_or_not/Picture7.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
                            <p>Finally, I wanted to see if the patterns seen across ODIs for the Indian national cricket
                              team showed up in the T20I category as well. The graph above shows that again, the Indian team
                              does a lot better when it bowls first even if it loses the toss. The fact that this is the case for T-
                              20’s alone lends greater weight to the overall trend because it shows that even in the shortest
                              format where dew makes the toss very important, the team wins more frequently if they bowl
                              first having won or lost the toss.</p>

                            <p>The numbers show that indeed the Indian cricket team has historically performed better
                              when bowling first. While this is by no means evidence that India should always bowl first, it
                              could be used as a factor when considering the toss in games when batting or bowling first is
                              seen as equally favorable. No matter what, I will always look forward to watching the Indian
                              cricket team continue to play great cricket, and to nervously awaiting their toss decisions.</p>

                        <p>The 49ers offense has gotten off to a scorching start this season. They are averaging 30+ points a game right now and they are near the top of the league in most major statistical categories . They are littered with skill position talents from the dynamic Christian McCaffrey to Deebo Samuel , Brandon Aiyuk, and George Kittle . They have a quarterback in Brock Purdy who is like a point guard who knows how to get the ball to his playmakers . The offensive line finds a way to just open up running lanes and maul opposing defenses. And to top it all off, they have arguably the best play caller in the league in Kyle Shanahan who has an incredibly creative scheme and finds ways to get his players the ball in open space for them to wreak havoc.</p>
