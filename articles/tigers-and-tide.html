                          <p>
                            On November 5, 2011, over 20 million fans of college football tuned into CBS to watch the #1 LSU Tigers take on the #2 Alabama Crimson Tide at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. The “Game of the Century”, as it was termed by many, was not only the most watched regular season game of the decade, but also stood for eight years as the last LSU win in the series, up until this past month’s matchup at Bryant-Denny on November 9, 2019. And despite all of the hype leading into what some dubbed “The Game of the Century: Part II”, Saturday’s #1 vs. #2 showdown did not disappoint in its magnitude or intrigue. However, quite paradoxically, in a game that shared so much of the situational significance of its early decade counterpart, this year’s edition of Tigers vs. Tide played out on the field in a completely different way.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            On paper, both meetings had similar occasion. An undefeated, #1 ranked LSU going on the road against an undefeated, #2 ranked Alabama in a game with conference and championship implications. Additionally, the quality of the players in both iterations was on full display. While the 2011 clash featured the most future NFL Draft picks of any SEC game in history, the 2019 contest featured two Heisman favorites in quarterbacks Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa.

                            Nonetheless, the experience of watching these two games could not have been any more distinct for the college football fan. The 2011 matchup was all about <b>defense</b>. In fact, between the two teams, it represented their highest combined defensive efficiency of the decade. Both LSU and Alabama employed a conservative offensive approach, each knowing that their best chance of winning would come from relying on their elite defenses, a strategy that was very apparent to viewers as well as in the 9-6 final score. Conversely, the 2019 matchup was all about <b>offense</b>. It represented their highest combined offensive efficiency of the decade. On top of that, it was the only matchup of the decade in which both teams had a higher offensive efficiency rating than defensive efficiency rating. Both teams played with more pace (147 total plays compared the 118 in 2011) and threw the ball at a greater rate (55% of plays were pass plays compared to the 39% rate of eight years prior). This stark divergence was obvious in the back-and-forth nature of the game and 46-41 final score. Moreover, the contrast was evident with respect to the most valuable players of each game. Whereas safety Tyrann Mathieu, better known as the “Honey Badger”, was arguably the most important player for LSU in the 2011 matchup, Burrow was unquestionably the spark plug behind the Tigers’ victory in 2019.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The graphs below serve to illustrate the degree to which the 2019 matchup was characterized by offense compared to the defense-dominated 2011 matchup. It can be seen that the 2019 edition amassed more than twice as many total yards than the 2011 game and more than tripled the latter in its number of explosive plays that went for 20 yards or more. These statistics are not a shock to anyone that watched both games but rather accentuate quantitatively just how different the two contests were.

                            Looking ahead into the future, it remains to be seen whether we could witness another rematch for the college football championship. In 2012, undefeated LSU and 1-loss Alabama were collectively deemed the two best teams in the country at the end of the year and were pegged to play again in the BCS Championship Game (in which the Tide rolled 21-0). Projecting this year’s College Football Playoff, LSU now controls its playoff destiny in the driver’s seat of the SEC and has 69% chance of reaching the playoff according to FiveThirtyEight. Alabama, given only an 11% chance to reach the playoff, on the other hand, faces a much tougher road, and must win out and hope for other top teams to stumble down the stretch. While statistically improbable, this route does have a precedent, as non-SEC champion, 1-loss Alabama was selected by the same system two seasons ago. Thus, while unlikely, it is entirely possible that we witness another rematch of the Tigers and the Tide in 2020.
