                          <p>
Flushing Meadows. Roland Garros. Melbourne Park. Wimbledon. The world of tennis revolves around these four tournaments, collectively known as the “Grand Slams”. Success at a Grand Slam brings with it fame, endorsements, and expectations. 
</p>

<p>
However, each Grand Slam is unique in its own way due to the varying surfaces (hard, grass, and clay), allowing different styles and players to win. Roger Federer glides over the grass at Wimbledon, Rafael Nadal dominates the clay courts of the French Open, and the hard courts at the US and Australian Opens are a toss up every year. Now, speed and court type are normally associated with groundstrokes in tennis, the forehand and the backhand, but does this carry over to the serve as well?
</p>

<p>
Any tennis player knows the significance of the serve and the return. Winning a match normally means that you must win all of your service games and “break” your opponent on their serve; breaking your opponent even just once or twice changes the tide of the match. Therefore, it stands to reason that those who have had success at a Grand Slam do this exceptionally. But there are the subtle differences between the varying Grand Slam surfaces.
</p>

<p>
I pulled seven data statistics on serves and returns from <a href="http://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/" target="_blank">Ultimate Tennis Statistics</a> for all 436 semifinalists in every Grand Slam since 1991. For example, in 2013, Jo Wilfried Tsonga reached the semifinal of the French Open and made 64.8% of his first serves, won 76.5% of his first serves, won 58.4% of his second serves, won 70.4% of his service points, won 37.5% of first serves he returned, 50% of second serves he returned, and 42.1% of all his serves returned. Taking the average of all these players, we can create a “baseline” of statistics for reaching the semifinal of a Grand Slam. 
</p>

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/serves-in-tennis/graph2.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
Now, looking at each specific Grand Slam, it becomes clear that there one statistic which never changes. Players will make their first serve at a percentage relatively close to 62.2% at all four Grand Slams. And this makes logical sense; first serves are relatively independent of the opponent, no matter the surface, and, in modern tennis, are powerful enough to consistently win the point. However, it’s the other statistics which display quite a large variation for a professional sport.
</p>

<p>
At the French Open, players are 3.78% less likely, compared to the “baseline” to win on their first serve, and they are 2.33% less likely to win any service point. The slower surface of the clay court has an impact on speed, not just on ground strokes, but immediately once the point starts. As a result, conversely, returners are 4.23% more likely to win off a first serve.
</p> 

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/serves-in-tennis/graph3.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
In the opposite direction, at Wimbledon’s grass courts, the server has a distinct advantage. First serves are won 3.67% more of the time due to the fast and sliding movements of the ball on grass. And therefore, players who are returning any serve win 2.94% less points. 
</p>

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/serves-in-tennis/graph4.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
In other words, a theoretical server at Wimbledon is 7.45% more likely to win his first serve compared to himself at the French Open. Even though nothing has changed between the two tournaments, the surface of the court already gives advantages to certain players. 
</p>

<p>
For example, only at Wimbledon does Roger Federer have >80% winning percentage on his first serve, compared to only 75.03% at the French Open. It’s no wonder that eight of his twenty(!) Grand Slams were won on the fast courts of Wimbledon. Similarly, Rafael Nadal has won eleven French Opens, where he wins returns 48.46% of the time, but on the faster, other three Grand Slams, he only wins returns at a combined average of 41.73%, and as a result, he only has six Grand Slams from all three of those.
</p>

<p>
This might not seem like a large discrepancy, but because winning the service game is so important in tennis, having any slight advantage helps players achieve that next level. Players need to understand their game and learn where to focus their talents if they want to achieve success in a Grand Slam. A player without a strong serve should gravitate towards clay tournaments to lead up to the French Open, a player who slams in serves should try focusing on Wimbledon, and players who have all-around game are lucky enough to have two Grand Slams to try and win. 
</p>

<p>
Of course, there will always be exceptions. That’s what makes greats such as Federer, Nadal, Sampras, and Djokovic great. They’re able to win anywhere at any time. But even the greats are only so good on certain surfaces.

                          Cricket is a game of tradition that has refused the influx of stats and analytics that now dominate most, if not all, aspects of modern sports. Yet, can we still figure out a data-driven way for certain strategies in cricket? And can teams begin to use this to their advantage? </p>
