                            <h4>By Mollie Tessler | February 27, 2019</h4>

                          <p>
United States soccer has a tale of two sexes. The USMNT failed to make the 2018 FIFA World Cup and were eliminated in just the Round of 16 four years earlier. On the contrary, the US Women’s World Cup team won the 2015 World Cup. They got paid an average of $37,800 whereas their male equivalents got paid an average of $300,000. The salary caps for men and women's teams vary as well, at $3 million versus $265,000 - respectively. Why is this? Why does the worse performing team get paid more? 
</p>

<p>
The answer to the question above put simply, the money to pay the female athletes more just doesn’t exist. The 2010 Men’s World Cup Team took in 9 percent of the total revenue, less than the 13 percent the women made. But, 13 percent of $10 million is less than 9% of $348 million. Men’s sports teams just bring in more money.
</p>

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/sexist-not-economics/graph1.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
Tickets to the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final started at $455 USD. For the 2015 FIFA World Cup, the most expensive finals tickets were $165. If both venues sold only their cheapest tickets, the 2018 final match would’ve brought in 13.5 times the tickets sales as the 2015 final match ($36,855,000 vs. $2,725,000). This money then translates to higher played athletes, and this doesn’t include the money from sponsors. Roughly 3.5 million fans went to the 64 matches during the 2014 World Cup, as opposed to the 1.3 million that went to the 2015 Women’s World Cup. 
</p>

<p>
Both World Cups got aired on the same network (FOX), but advertisers paid vastly different prices for covering of the games. The 2015 Women's World Cup brought in $17 million in revenue, whereas the 2014 men's World Cup brought in $529 million. This is 31.1 times that of the 2015 Cup. People just don't watch women's soccer or attend the games in as high of numbers. 
</p>

<p>
This difference doesn’t just exist within soccer, but with most sports as well. NBA players make an average of $4.5 million, WNBA players make $72,000. They make 1.6% as much as male players.
</p> 

<div> <span class="image centered"><img alt="" src="../images/dj-pics/sexist-not-economics/graph2.png"/></span>
</div>

<p>
Female soccer players make too little to even appear on this graph. 
</p>

<p>
While the Major Baseball League was founded in 1869, the NPF was revived in 2004. And the players on the team make under $10,000 per season. Women’s sports just aren’t as desired by fans.
</p>

<p>
This isn’t just something that exists within the professional sports world, but the collegiate one as well. Coaches for male sports get paid a significantly higher amount than female sports- even at the same university. In 1963, Federal law stated that salaries of men and women had to be proportional to each other, given their profits. This idea makes the difference in wages not sexist, just economical. Women are 43.4 percent of student-athletes, and less of these athletes move onto the professional realm. 1.2% of all Male NCAA basketball players will move onto the professional leagues, as opposed to 0.9% of Women's NCAA basketball players. This trend extends even back to High School, men are just more involved in sports as well. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
Women aren’t being paid less because they’re women, they’re being paid less because their sports generate less revenue, in part because of the lower fan base and lower emphasis placed onto female athletes from an early age. Can this change in the future? Yes, but for the time being, the trend is most likely to continue.
