Most successful college football program of the last decade? Alabama.
Most successful college football coach of the last decade? Nick Saban.
</p>

<p>
This premise is something any sensible fan of the sport knows to be true. After all, the dynastic system has laid claim to 5 of the last 10 national championships, with no other school having hoisted the trophy more than once in this span. They have lost just 14 of their last 150 games. Since 2009, they have been the Associated Press No. 1 team in the country for a grand total of 80 weeks, more than all other schools combined. However, a more intriguing question remains unanswered: Which Alabama team has been Saban’s best? Was it his undefeated team in 2009 headlined by Greg McElroy, Mark Ingram, and Julio Jones? Or potentially his 2011 team whose star-studded defense blanked LSU in the national title game? Or his A.J. McCarron, Eddie Lacy, and Amari Cooper-led team that obliterated Notre Dame to win it all in 2012? Has the unblemished 2018 team, featuring beloved Heisman favorite Tua Tagovailoa, merely replicated the standard that Saban has set for Crimson Tide football, or has it transcended the potency of previous teams, including his national championship-winning ones?
</p>

<p>
In the search for an analytical answer to this exciting prospect, we must start with the difficult task of figuring out how exactly to assess the relative success of a football team across different years. Perhaps the most natural place to start would be with SRS, the Simple Rating System, an objective value which takes both average point differential and strength of schedule into consideration. College football SRS is calculated by starting with a team’s average point differential in a season and adjusting for variation in strength of schedule by adding the average combined point differential of all its opponents. Looking at the chart below, of Saban’s 12 years at Alabama, this year’s 2018 team has his highest SRS yet, and by a relatively wide margin at that.

<p>
Among other metrics of success in college football, most analytics experts in the field agree that turnover margin and yards per play margin provide insight into relative degrees of dominance. In addition, the two complement each other very well. Every coach in the nation knows that turnovers can win and lose games. Therefore, a dominant team should have a consistently high turnover margin. Nevertheless, teams cannot rely on turnovers alone and must be able to mount a formidable attack and maintain a staunch defense. Therefore, a dominant team should have a consistently high yards per play margin, which measures the difference between average offensive yards gained per play and average defensive yards allowed per play. The graphs below only bolster an argument for the 2018 Alabama team being Saban’s premier side, barely coming second in turnover margin and leading dramatically in yards per play margin.

<p>
Moreover, it has been well documented in recent years that one of the most accurate measurements of team success is efficiency rating. Popularized by Ken Pomeroy in college basketball, offensive and defensive efficiencies can also apply to college football, on the basis of each unit’s per-play contribution.

<p>
The chart above displays Alabama’s efficiencies over the last 12 years, with its defensive efficiency, the real foundation of the team, on the bottom, and its offensive efficiency, which I believe dictates the ceiling of an Alabama team, above. It should be noticed that defensive efficiency has been the more consistently dominant of the two measures under Saban, likely due to the culture of the team and prioritization in recruiting. However, in 2012 and 2018, the two years that offensive efficiency has especially flourished and been in the 90s, it is clear the cumulative efficiency rating has been the highest of Saban’s tenure in Tuscaloosa. This phenomenon, particularly evident among this year’s team with an almost perfect 100, further supports the case that it has been Saban’s most dynamic outfit yet.
</p>

<p>
Last season, after Nick Saban’s decision to replace the stagnant Jalen Hurts with the inexperienced Tua Tagovailoa in the National Championship Game, the Hawaiian southpaw’s subsequent display of immense will and ability in a miraculous comeback had every coach in the country trembling at the thought of a 2018 Alabama with Tua at the helm. Now, having vanquished calls of being a one-hit-wonder, Tagovailoa has brought something to Tuscaloosa that Nick Saban and college football have never seen before. From Rolando McClain to C.J. Mosley to D’Onta Hightower, Saban’s Alabama teams have always had swarming defenders, as does the 2018 team with Quinnen Williams, Deionte Thompson, and Raekwon Davis. From Mark Ingram to Trent Richardson to Eddie Lacy to Derrick Henry, Alabama has always had elite athletes at the running back position, as does the 2018 team with the three-headed monster of Damien Harris, Najee Harris, and John Jacobs. From Julio Jones to Amari Cooper to Calvin Ridley, they have always had talented #1 wide receivers, as does the 2018 team with Jerry Jeudy, even adding meaningful contributions from secondary wideouts Henry Ruggs III and Jaylen Waddle. However, in very few years has Alabama added a masterful quarterback to this already potent recipe. Under Saban, perhaps the most complete it has been was with A.J. McCarron in command of the offense, which operated productively through the air as well as on the ground. His peak in 2012 corresponded with a significantly increased offensive efficiency rating, building on an already effective running game and defense. The team’s massive win over Notre Dame in the BCS National Championship game concluded a season that was solid across all four metrics, likely Saban’s statistical second-best. That being said, A.J. McCarron is not Tua Tagovailoa. Tagovailoa has the highest Total Quarterback Rating of all starting quarterbacks since it was first calculated in 2004. He has been the missing piece to the Alabama puzzle, albeit one that really didn’t need solving in the first place. Nonetheless, the best college football teams are dominant on all fronts, something that this year’s Alabama team can clearly tout. With SRS, yards per play margin, and efficiency ratings all eclipsing the imposing totals of previous teams, and an exceptional turnover margin that is just runner-up, I can definitively say that the 2018 Alabama team is Saban’s best ever. So far.
