                  <strong> Summary:</strong> We are working with Bleacher Report Creator Studio (BRCS). Bleacher Report Creator Studio (BRCS), Bleacher Report's beta livestream platform, is intended to create a dedicated home for live content and creator-driven experiences. The goal of BRCS is to bridge the gap between social reach and app engagement.

                  The goal of this project is to look at what top competitor platforms like Twitch and YouTube Live are doing well, identify gaps and opportunities in the BRCS experience, and propose concrete, buildable ways to improve user acquisition, engagement, and retention. We will conduct a detailed competitive teardown of top-performing creator-driven, sports-centric streaming platforms,based on competitive research, propose implementation-ready feature recommendations, product experiments, and growth loops for product growth roadmap.

                  <strong> Summary:</strong> For the West Project, SAGB is tasked with developing a skeleton proposal for a community-focused event aimed at both fostering social impact and offering NIL donation opportunities for athletes. Scheduled for the spring semester, this event will resemble the UCLA West Project gala with auctions, sponsor involvement, and tiered donations to generate funding and community engagement. The skeleton proposal will emphasize fundraising components, setting a target of $300,000 and identifying specific activations like donation tiers that outline impact levels, such as supporting new coaching initiatives or expanding programs. The proposal will also include preliminary plans for digital outreach, such as an e-blast featuring key donors, and programming.

This will include connecting sports science data via APIs to cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift and then using visualization tools such as tableau or power BI to build dashboards providing global team, positional, and individual player views.
