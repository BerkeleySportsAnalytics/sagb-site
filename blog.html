                    The offensive line. That’s what. The Browns’ offense was the exact same in most areas from 2019 to 2020. They still had Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry, 2 All-Pro receivers. They still had Kareem Hunt and Nick Chubb, 2 All-Pro running backs. They did add Austin Hooper, but he didn’t contribute much outside of blocking. The main difference from 2019 to 2020 was the offensive line. That’s where the magic happened and translated to the entire offense and ultimately the entire team being better.

                    The Vikings traded Stefon Diggs for a first-round pick to the Bills during the 2020 offseason. This seems to be a trade where both sides were winners, which doesn’t happen very often in the NFL for big trades(see the Deandre Hopkins and Jamal Adams trades). The Vikings used that pick to draft Justin Jefferson, who went on to have a historic rookie season. Stefon Diggs also in his own right had an amazing year for the Bills. He emerged as a definitive top 5, arguably top 3 receiver, in the NFL and was AP First Team All-Pro.

                    As I have written about before, there is a special formula that nearly all March Madness winners have followed. This holistic guide includes metrics relevant to momentum, talent, experience, balance, and toughness, and is detailed comprehensively below.

                    It’s finally back. After a 24-month long hiatus, March Madness is here again and
promises to bring double the upsets to make up for lost time. Although limited in
capacity and geography, this year’s tourney comes to us with the distinct advantage
of being the easiest ever to get away with watching during class. But before you
start switching tabs between Zoom and March Madness Live, you must put pen to
paper and make your picks. And that brings us to everyone’s favorite trendy upset
pick, the 12-seed over the 5. While it seems like these matchups reliably produce
upsets every year, you shouldn’t just blindly pick the 12-seed with your favorite
mascot. Rather, you can be much more precise in your judgment by once again
turning to our old friends, offensive and defensive efficiency.

                    Baseball is a gorgeously paced game, to an extent that almost defies description. Its drama operates 
                    in negative space, the slow-burning tension that matures and warps and snaps into action. The ball moves 
                    faster than in any other game this side of jai alai, tearing through still air and distilling the game into 
                    a series of rapid, beautifully unfair uncertainties. Wins are the 0-1 binary outcome the best run-creating and 
                    run-preventing efforts of 50 players are reduced to, and it is in their service that baseball, at least when the 
                    world is spinning, is played.

                    I was distraught by the NBA season’s cancellation in early March. Fantasy basketball had
                  become a large part of my life, I was fresh off of a championship in my league, and I was almost
                  guaranteed a second one this year. Coming home from school and finishing the semester at home
                  was devastating, yet it may have been a blessing in disguise because I began actively managing
                  my own portfolio. In doing so, I realized that the skills I gained in fantasy basketball were highly
                  applicable to trading.
