                    Baseball is a gorgeously paced game, to an extent that almost defies description. Its drama operates 
                    in negative space, the slow-burning tension that matures and warps and snaps into action. The ball moves 
                    faster than in any other game this side of jai alai, tearing through still air and distilling the game into 
                    a series of rapid, beautifully unfair uncertainties. Wins are the 0-1 binary outcome the best run-creating and 
                    run-preventing efforts of 50 players are reduced to, and it is in their service that baseball, at least when the 
                    world is spinning, is played.

                    I was distraught by the NBA season’s cancellation in early March. Fantasy basketball had
                  become a large part of my life, I was fresh off of a championship in my league, and I was almost
                  guaranteed a second one this year. Coming home from school and finishing the semester at home
                  was devastating, yet it may have been a blessing in disguise because I began actively managing
                  my own portfolio. In doing so, I realized that the skills I gained in fantasy basketball were highly
                  applicable to trading.
