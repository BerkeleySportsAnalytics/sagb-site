                          <h3>Our Teams</h3>

                          <h4>Projects </h4>

                          <p>This committee aims to do research projects that are either self directed or consulting projects with professional sports teams. Work will be done in teams four and will be typically be based around a single topic/teams questions. So far we have gotten projects from the San Jose Earthquakes about concession pricing and about the most effective way to gain fans. We are also reaching out to teams in the NBA, MLB, NFL and various minor league sports to get more projects. Priority will be given to people with a strong CS/Stats background, especially people that know anything about machine learning, although these are not the only skills applicants will be judged by.</p>

                          <h4>Data Journalism</h4>

                          <p>This committee is about coming together to discuss trending topics in the sports world with peers; and then making bold, and impartial, statements or predictions using evidence supported via analytics and statistics. You can write about any sport with data, from Basketball to Baseball to Pigeon Racing!
